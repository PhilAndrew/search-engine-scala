Modification History 
6.1.1 Policy scope and objectives 
This policy addresses the administration of contracts and other types of agreements
  such as memoranda of understanding (MOUs). QUT is committed to ensuring that contracts and agreements
  are entered into by appropriately delegated officers following due consideration of risks, benefits,
  other relevant requirements and accountabilities, and alignment with QUT's strategic ambitions and
  top-level plans (where applicable). This policy deals with both legally binding contracts and deeds,
  and with memoranda of understanding which are formal or strategic agreements but do not bind QUT in
a strict legal sense.
Contracts and MOUs entered into on behalf of QUT must be administered in a way which:
minimises the risks associated with the contract or MOU;
maximises the benefits for QUT;
incorporates probity, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness into their management;
is consistent with legislation, QUT policies and procedures and QUT's compliance obligations;
in the case of contracts, is consistent with the State Procurement Policy 2008 requirements and
    objectives, such as the advancement of government priorities and achieving value for money (for further
    details see the State Procurement Policy's Better Purchasing Guides);
in the case of MOUs, is consistent with QUT's strategic ambitions and top-level plans;
ensures best practice management of the contract or MOU; and
complies with corporate governance structures.
The employment of staff is addressed separately under the University's Enterprise Bargaining Agreements
  and associated Human Resources policies.
Top 
6.1.2 Definitions 
Different delegations and accountabilities will apply depending on whether an
  agreement executed on behalf of QUT is a contract or a memorandum of understanding. There are two types
  of legally binding agreements, contracts and deeds. In contrast, memoranda of understanding are not
legally binding.
The following definitions will assist in distinguishing a contract (or deed) from a memorandum of
  understanding. In this policy, the general term “ 
agreement
” is used where the requirements
  relate to both contracts and MOUs.
A 
contract
is an agreement between parties intended to have legal significance and
  involving the transfer of consideration (that is, value – financial or some other type of benefit -
  flowing from the beneficiary of the transaction). Contracts generally articulate business relationships
  for the acquisition or supply of goods or services, for the exploitation or transfer of intellectual
  property rights (eg licences) or for the provision of funding.
Some contracts require reference to other University policies and procedures including:
contracting capital works and related projects;
provision of commercial research or consultancies;
appointment of consultants;
intellectual property agreements.
A 
deed
is also a form of legally binding or contractual document, but requires a
  greater degree of formality for its creation. The QUT seal must be affixed to a deed and the deed must
  always be signed by the Vice-Chancellor (or Chancellor) and Registrar (for further details see MOPP 
A/1.4
  Execution of an agreement as a deed ensures that the specified terms and conditions are legally enforceable,
  even in the absence of consideration or where a unilateral promise or commitment is made.
A 
memorandum of understanding (MOU)
is a document intended to formalise the terms
  of a relationship, arrangement or understanding between QUT and another party, but is not intended
  to be legally binding on either party. An MOU possesses moral force only, and is generally a formal,
  mutually agreed but diplomatic document, setting out principles, strategies and mechanisms for dealing
  with the common issues of the relationship. It may lead to the development of separate contracts with
legal intent.
Top 
6.1.3 Risk management 
QUT is committed to managing the risks associated with contracts and other types
  of agreements in a systematic way (see MOPP 
A/2.5
and
  QUT's 
Risk Management Framework
  Consequently, an analysis of risks and benefits must be undertaken prior to entering into the agreement,
  and it is the responsibility of the delegate authorised to sign the agreement to ensure that risk management
  issues have been addressed. Continuous evaluation of risk during performance or over the life of the
  agreement should also be undertaken and this is the responsibility of the designated contract or MOU
manager (for further detail on the role of the contract or MOU manager, see section G/6.1.5 below).
Guidelines, including a checklist of issues which should be addressed to reduce risk, information
  to be included in the documents to be executed and the sources of relevant advice, have been developed
  and are published on the 
Registrar's website
(a) Addressing risk prior to entering into the contract or MOU
QUT should enter an agreement only after the following issues have been addressed:
the adequacy of QUT's insurance provisions including coverage for indemnities (consult
    the Division of Finance and Resource Planning for advice on insurance policies or see MOPP 
A/7.1
in the case of contracts, the inclusion of performance management strategies within
    the terms of the contract (eg using performance targets or milestones as triggers for payments, including
      the use of an agreed supplier service level agreement (SLA) or key performance indicators (KPIs)
    in contracts);
in the case of contracts, an expiry or termination date is specified;
in the case of MOUs, a timeframe is specified after which review of the arrangement
    should be undertaken;
operational, workload, space or human resources impacts of the contract or MOU for
    relevant areas of the University;
any reputational risks if the contract or MOU fails for any reason, or any impacts
    on other potential business suppliers or educational partners by virtue of the contract or MOU;
the need for due diligence checks in relation to the other party/ies to the agreement;
the documents to be signed are in an appropriate form, comply with any legal formalities
      and contain standard terms and conditions (see below).
(b) Standard terms and conditions
Risk is mitigated when the legal effect of the contract or MOU is clear from its terms. For instance,
  if an arrangement is intended to be or is legally binding, it must never be referred to as an MOU.
  If the document is diplomatic or strategic only, it must always be referred to as a MOU and must include
  a clause or specific statement to the effect that it is not intended to create legally binding obligations.
Risk is also reduced significantly when a contract contains standard terms and conditions to ensure
  all relevant matters are addressed and to aid interpretation. The following resources should be used
  wherever possible:
  QUT standard procurement and       consultancy terms and conditions - refer to Strategic Procurement Section,       Corporate Finance Department
Capital works and building maintenance
IT contracts: Government Information Technology Conditions for Information (GITC) and Communication Technology requirements
Research and revenue consultants and contractors, Office of Commercial Services (OCS)
Office of Research
In low or medium risk contracts, non-standard contractual terms and conditions should be compared
  against the standard suite of contracts available from these sources and QUT standard terms added where
  necessary. For high risk contracts, legal advice must be obtained.
(c) Obtaining advice on terms, conditions or the effect of a contract
Legal advice must be sought from either the Office of Commercial Services or via the Registrar's Office
  where:
significant legal issues are involved (for instance, where a guarantee is given or
    if there is an exclusion or limitation of liability by the other party in respect of breaches of
    the agreement or for negligence);
the contract is complex or high risk (for instance, relating to intellectual property,
      research commercialisation or consultancy, contracts with an international component, or expert
    witness services) and the other party has proposed non-standard or non-QUT mandated terms and conditions
    (listed above);
it is not clear whether the proposed agreement is legally binding or requires formalities
      for execution (such as execution under seal); or
in the case of high risk or complex contracts, the contract terms and conditions have
      been developed or provided by the other party.
A contract containing a clause in which QUT indemnifies third parties can only be executed if the
  conditions specified in MOPP 
A/7.1
are
  met. Advice concerning indemnities can be obtained through the Division of Finance and Resource Planning.
Advice on all procurement or research and other commercial contracting should be directed to Strategic
  Procurement, Department of Financial Services, and Office of Commercial Services, Division of Research
  and Commercialisation, respectively.
(d) Management of risk over the life of the contract or agreement
A key aspect of managing risk during the performance of the contract or agreement is the appointment
  of a designated contract or MOU manager. The responsibilities of the contract or MOU manager are listed
  in section G/6.1.5 below. Additionally, the use of appropriate records management strategies for retention
  of the contract or agreement documentation (records of negotiations, the signed document and later
  interactions with the other party/ies to the agreement) is also essential to controlling risk (see
  section G/6.1.6 below).
Top 
6.1.4 Delegation of authority to enter into agreements 
QUT Council has delegated authority to enter/sign all contracts or agreements
  on behalf of the University to the Vice-Chancellor. Except in the case of University-level strategic
  agreements, contracts where the financial worth cannot be valued or is in excess of $1,000,000, the
  Vice-Chancellor has further delegated this authority to nominated senior officers of the University.
Different delegations apply depending on:
the value of the contract (in the case of commercial arrangements);
whether the document requires execution under seal; or
the nature and scope of the MOU.
A legally binding contract may be signed by a delegate provided that the contract value is consistent
  with the financial value or expenditure limit specified in the delegation. MOUs may only be signed
  by the Vice-Chancellor, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International and Development), the Deputy Vice-Chancellor
  (Research and Commercialisation), the Registrar or the executive dean of a faculty, depending on the nature of
  the MOU. A document under seal must always be executed by the Vice-Chancellor (or Chancellor) and Registrar.
For full details, consult the Schedule of Authorities and Delegations, 
MOPP
      Appendix 3. Specific requirements for execution under seal are explained in
      MOPP 
A/1.4
Top 
6.1.5 Role and responsibilities of the contract or MOU manager 
The delegate authorising the contract or MOU is responsible for the appointment
  of a contract or MOU manager. The contract or MOU manager will not normally be the authorised delegate,
  but another University officer having operational or administrative responsibility for matters within
the scope of the document.
The contract or MOU manager is responsible for:
managing the negotiation process for the contract or MOU;
ensuring that, in the case of a contract for the supply of goods or services, the contracted goods
    and / or services are delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract;
in the case of other agreements, ensuring that relevant steps are taken operationally to ensure
    compliance by QUT and the other party with the terms of the agreement;
records management and retention (see G/6.1.6 below);
performance monitoring and review of the contract or MOU, in accordance with Service Level Agreements
    (SLA) and / or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), negotiated at the time of the agreement is entered
    into;
performance reporting.
Top 
6.1.6 Records management, storage and retention 
Developing and retaining appropriate records of the negotiation, execution (of documentation outlining
  the terms and conditions) and ongoing monitoring of QUT's contracts and MOUs is vital to ensuring that
  the University is aware of its obligations, can protect its interests including in possible litigation,
  maintain corporate memory and for audit and compliance purposes. Consequently, the contract or MOU
  manager is responsible for ensuring that these types of records are kept.
(a) Records registration
The following QUT secured records management systems should be used where possible:
corporate records management system offered by Records Management Services (Governance Services);
Contractors and Consultants Database (Facilities Management Department) for capital works, real
    estate and related facility services;
Commercial Projects Database (Office of Commercial Services) for research, associated consultancies
    and commercial services worldwide;
Standing Offer (SOA) and       Preferred Supplier (PSA) Arrangements registered by Corporate Finance; 
general consultancies are       recorded in the University finance system and managed by Corporate Finance.
Where the above registers are not utilised, faculties and divisions must maintain a register of their
  contracts and MOUs to meet business needs, legal requirements and other compliance required by QUT
  policies and procedures.
The following details of the contract or MOU must be registered:
specific reference number;
names of the parties involved;
contract/MOU manager name, position and contact details (both email and phone);
description of the goods and / or services provided for QUT business (where applicable), or in
    the case of MOUs, a description of the objectives of the agreement and the actions to be undertaken
    by QUT;
known or estimated dollar value (where applicable);
period of the contract or MOU, including review and extension options (as appropriate);
date of commencement (contracts);
specified outcomes / benefits to be achieved for QUT (optional);
letters of termination or extension.
To support these details, the following documentation must be managed within a recordkeeping system:
the original submissions / procurement plan / project business case or documents relating to the
    development phase of the MOU;
successful tender/s and basis of evaluation;
the signed contract or MOU including terms, conditions, intellectual property rights, letters of
    intent or acceptance;
the agreed SLAs and/or KPIs;
the agreed variations or amendments;
performance review outcomes and minutes of vendor meetings;
lodged complaints;
related correspondence.
(b) Records storage
The minimum level of original documentation to be stored is based on the risk / value of the contract,
  per the table below:
Risk / $ Value 
Recommended level of records management documentation
Level 4 - Extreme or high risk and high value
Retention in a secured fireproof records management area (Governance Services
        and Facilities Management Department)
Level 3 - High risk and low value 
Retention in a secured records management area
Level 2 - Medium or low risk and high value
Retention in an open records management area
Level 1 - Medium or low risk and low value
Retention on site
The above risks, levels and values are defined in QUT's Risk Management Framework 
A/2.5
) and QUT's
  Purchasing Policy (
G/5.3
The mandatory periods for retention of agreements are defined in the  Queensland State Archives General Retention and Disposal Schedule for  Administrative Records and the  University  Sector Retention and Disposal Schedule  (refer to http://www.governance.qut.edu.au/rms/retention_disposal/
for
  further details).
Top 
6.1.7 Performance monitoring and periodic review 
The contract or MOU manager must ensure that the contract or MOU is monitored and reviewed periodically
  over its life.
For contracts, a review should not only consider the performance of suppliers against the agreed supplier
  SLA or KPIs, but also the performance of the contract against the benefits planned for QUT. The contract
  must be reviewed prior to finalisation or any extension. A contract checklist has been developed to
  assist contract managers in analysing and monitoring progress of the contract. A copy of the checklist  can be obtained from the
   Finance and Resource Planning website.
Payments should be linked to performance as defined in the contract terms and conditions.
In the case of MOUs, the MOU manager must ensure that the MOU continues to fulfil its objectives,
  and that all parties to the MOU continue their commitment to the relationship. An MOU should always
  include a time period after which a review of the agreement will be undertaken. The review should examine
  benefits to QUT and alignment with QUT strategic ambitions and top-level plans.
