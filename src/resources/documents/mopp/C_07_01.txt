7.1.1 Policy principles  
QUT&rsquo;s vision to provide outstanding learning  environments and programs that lead to excellent outcomes for graduates (A/2.1.1) calls for teaching  practice that demonstrates skill and knowledge in the disciplines and in tertiary  pedagogy, and a learning-centred approach. 
High quality teaching:
  engages all students as partners in learning in ways that develop curiosity-driven, research-proficient  approaches, and maximise each individual&rsquo;s personal and professional  development
  influences, motivates and  inspires students to learn so that they become independent lifelong learners
  sets clear academic expectations and maintains high  standards
  draws on real-world practices so that students understand the application of knowledge 
  shows discipline expertise and a command of the field expressed through curriculum initiatives, learning  resources, and technologies that reflect current research
  capitalises on assessment and feedback as key components of learning and teaching 
  is built on effective organisation of the learning environment
  engages individually and  with peers in continuous improvement of teaching, through evaluative and  reflective practices that are underpinned by the scholarship of teaching and  learning
  is underpinned by an institutional culture that recognises, values and rewards teaching excellence and fosters communities of practice that support and advance scholarly teaching.

7.1.2 Policy outcomes 
This policy is designed to:
  document and promote the characteristics and obligations of high quality teaching 
  provide a framework through which the University can facilitate and support high quality teaching.  
Top 
7.1.3 Approaches to high quality teaching  
QUT&rsquo;s courses are designed to support student  learning, embed real world learning pedagogies and reflect a whole of course  design (C/4.2). Teaching approaches  should reflect these key characteristics of curriculum design by focussing on  teaching for learning, using assessment as a pedagogical strategy to support  student learning, and the effective planning of learning environments. High  quality teaching incorporates a leadership role which focuses on both personal  learning and collaborating with peers to develop and implement innovations and  improvements in teaching practice.
QUT&rsquo;s Teaching Capabilities Framework provides practical guidelines to assist teaching staff in the  development of their practice and scholarship in teaching and learning.  Teaching staff undertake various academic leadership responsibilities in the course  design, curriculum development, implementation and review of learning and  teaching. These are described in B/3.5. 
a)	Teaching for learning
To support student learning, teaching approaches  need to foster active and deep learning.
High quality teaching relies on knowledge of 
  disciplinary specialisation in sufficient depth so that rather than staying with a predetermined &lsquo;script,&rsquo; the teacher can capitalise on opportunities to capture students&rsquo; interest and extend students&rsquo; understanding
  new thinking and explorations occurring in current research in the discipline
  the disciplinary content and skills that students need to master as learning outcomes
  what students already know and can do (ie understanding how and where particular units fit within a whole course design)
  the fundamentals of adult learning processes
  the importance of student engagement in learning 
  what students are experiencing in their classes.
High quality teaching is exemplified by professional practice that
  encourages students to find personal meaning in concepts so they build deep knowledge
  embraces ways of communicating the importance and relevance of the content towards mastery of the field of knowledge and professional practice
  shows clarity in communicating complex concepts and relationships
  encompasses feedback loops that quickly alert the teacher when students have not yet grasped critical concepts or ideas
  utilises a wide range of pedagogical strategies
  provides positive role models for students
  shares innovations and ideas to motivate peers to collaborate on teaching improvements
  embodies an inspirational influence on teaching and student learning.
High quality teaching draws on human characteristics that value
  commitment to student learning
  the excitement of intellectual power of their discipline and what it offers students for the future
  debate and collaboration in order to encourage positive ideas for improvement
  curiosity about learning and teaching, so there can be systematic investigation of their students&rsquo; learning and reflection on teaching
  commitment to personal learning as teachers and enthusiasm about the opportunities provided by teaching practice.
b)	Assessing for learning
Assessment serves multiple purposes. Assessment is valued as a pedagogical  strategy that supports student learning, as well as being used to track  individual student learning and provide data to inform judgements about how  well the course is helping students master the desired learning outcomes (C/5.1). 
High quality teaching demonstrates the ability  to
  design meaningful and challenging assessment tasks that are clearly aligned to learning outcomes 
  use assessment techniques that help students monitor their own learning progress and develop their own professional judgment
  implement a range of assessment and feedback strategies to provide students with meaningful feedback on their learning progress
  understand how particular assessment tasks and outcomes fit within a whole of course design
  aggregate data from student assessment tasks to monitor student performance.
c)	Managing for learning
Student learning is enhanced by the effective  planning and organisation of learning environments, including the use of  available human resources and the provision of physical and virtual  resources. High quality university  teaching requires a significant level of organisational and leadership  capability.
High quality teaching displays expertise in
  maintaining professional relationships with colleagues, and functioning as an effective team member 
  anticipating the practical requirements of teaching, including preparing materials and resources to ensure smooth organisation of teaching activities
  planning a learning environment that optimally integrates physical and virtual resources to fit a diversity of student and content needs 
  making optimal use of QUT student systems to support student learning.
Top 
7.1.4 Support for high quality teaching  
Teaching staff are encouraged to gain formal  qualifications in teaching in higher education, and to maintain an academic teaching  portfolio that includes reflections of teaching practice and changes made to  practice in response to feedback. QUT  provides professional development and grants for teachers across the career  span, and fosters communities of practice to advance scholarly teaching  (see the Learning and Teaching Unit website and B/5.1).
Top 
7.1.5 Continuous improvement of teaching 
QUT&rsquo;s framework for the evaluation of courses,  units, teaching and student experience (C/4.7) emphasises the use of  student feedback to inform continuous improvement of learning and teaching. 
QUT requires that all teaching staff undertake  a systematic approach to the continuous improvement of their teaching (C/4.7.3) and expects systematic reflection on their learning and teaching behaviours. This process of critical reflection may involve self-analysis or  collegial processes and may involve different degrees of critical examination  of teaching. 
High quality teaching is exemplified by
  self assessment of current teaching performance through regular use of the University approved student evaluation systems (C/4.7.2) together with       additional data sources such as 
    student focus groups or highly targeted feedback mechanisms
    feedback from peers, practicing professionals or experts in the discipline area in the form of observation of their teaching, or comments on teaching materials or learning resources
    employer feedback and feedback from professional organisations
  appropriate analysis of data and critical reflection on the impact of current teaching approaches to achieve desired student learning outcomes
  appropriate actions in response to feedback and reflection, to make improvements and provide feedback to students on these responses and their outcomes 
  evaluating assessment approaches to ensure they accurately assess the learning outcomes of the unit, meet the learning needs of students, and are defensible in terms of Australian academic standards
  leadership in initiating and actively participating in professional dialogue with peers regarding teaching and learning approaches that engage learners
  planning an appropriate personal professional development program, and
  developing and maintaining a system for keeping a teaching portfolio of  scholarly teaching activities and reflections.
Roles and  responsibilities relating to analysing data and planning and monitoring appropriate actions are provided in C/4.7.
