4.1.1 Design guidelines 
4.1.2 Energy management 
4.1.3 Access for people with disabilities 
Modification History 
QUT's physical facilities include many buildings of different types, sizes and styles, constructed at various times since 1911 and on three different campuses. The University has therefore adopted guidelines for future works and for refurbishment to existing facilities, which provide
a common context for architectural and engineering considerations of all projects outlined in the University's Asset Management Plan and for other building works carried out by the University, to optimise life cycle costs; and
compliance with legal requirements, including health and safety and access for people with disabilities, and good business and building practice.

4.1.1 Design guidelines 
Although specific restraints and standards are determined for each capital project by the relevant design team (see 
H/4.3
), these guidelines set out the University's minimum requirements for the design and construction of its facilities, giving priority to
economy of construction
ease of maintenance
availability of replacement parts
benefits of bulk purchasing
consistency in the use of materials, colours, landscaping etc within and across campuses
Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD) principles.
Facilities Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining design guidelines for the University through
preparation of master plans for each campus to provide for the controlled development, expansion or upgrading of the University with regard to such elements as site allocation, service corridors, services infrastructure, traffic, parking, landscaping, sporting facilities etc
design input into all major facilities projects and into any facilities projects which impact on the strategic/master plans of the University, and the recording of any variations to these plans
preparation and maintenance of Design Standards and Guidelines, including Heritage Management Guidelines, for the University's environment (full details of which are included on the 
Facilities Management Web Page

4.1.2 Energy management 
Energy management relates to the effective and efficient use of resource utilities such as electricity, 
gas, oil and water. The aim of an energy management program is to contain or reduce overall costs of 
energy use per unit of output. This involves life-cycle-cost design analyses of existing and new building 
services and systems (eg large air-conditioning, lighting installations etc).

4.1.3 Access for people with disabilities 
The University recognises that people with limited mobility face additional barriers to access buildings and facilities. It is reasonable that people with disabilities have an expectation that they are able to make their way around with a similar degree of ease and safety as experienced by other campus users. It is recognised that in making buildings and facilities accessible to people with disabilities, others will also benefit.
Policy and detailed guidelines relating to access to buildings and facilities for people with disabilities are continually being reviewed by the University (see 
A/8.6
