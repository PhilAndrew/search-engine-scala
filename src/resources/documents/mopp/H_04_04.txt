Modification History 
The University recognises the benefits of providing a productive working environment for staff and students and therefore undertakes to provide airconditioning in all future buildings and existing unairconditioned spaces. However, this does not negate the need to investigate and integrate passive solutions (eg shading, insulation, building orientation, natural and forced ventilation) into new buildings and major renovations wherever possible. 
Top 
4.4.1 Chilled water precincts 
Airconditioning in the University will be based on chilled water precincts as opposed to split and packaged systems and unitary self-contained units. Existing packaged systems should continue to operate to the end of their life at which time the plant wherever possible should be converted to chilled water operation. 
The use of unitary self-contained units is not permitted under any circumstances.

4.4.2 Criteria for prioritising future works 
Priorities are set according to greatest need, taking into consideration the purpose or function for which a space is used and the thermal performance of the area. The prioritisation process must consider the following 
'Thermal Comfort at Work' published by the Australian Government Publishing Service 
recorded data (eg temperature, humidity, noise, air changes) 
design attributes of the building, floor or space. 
The following prioritised list forms the basis of any functional assessment. 
vivariums 
large computing facilities 
specialist equipment installations 
internal spaces with no natural ventilation 
libraries 
spaces which have unacceptably high background noise (eg freeway) 
larger teaching spaces, including large seminar rooms ( 
75 seats) 
large teaching laboratories 
offices with poor natural or forced ventilation or poor structural insulation 
music practice areas 
large open office spaces 
smaller seminar rooms ( 
75 seats) 
committee rooms 
individual (small) laboratories 
tutorial rooms 
well ventilated staff offices 
common rooms/staff rooms/lunch rooms 
other well ventilated spaces 
refectories 
gymnasia.

4.4.3 Implementation of airconditioning program 
The University aims to ensure that all unairconditioned spaces are airconditioned by the year 2010. 
The funding for chilled water infrastructure will be provided for in the University's Asset Management Plan and all capital projects (including renovation) are to address airconditioning, even if the work is to be completed in stages. 
Faculties, schools or departments may fund their own airconditioning, provided the systems are approved by the Director, Facilities Management and the work does not disadvantage other projects prioritised according to 
H/4.4.2
