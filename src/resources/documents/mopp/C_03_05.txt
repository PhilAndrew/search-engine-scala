Modification History 
3.5.1 Policy principles 
QUT aims, through the delivery of  transnational award courses, to develop relationships with high quality  partners from countries of particular focus for QUT, where the relationships  are sustainable and bring multiple benefits and improved reputation or prestige  for both partners. QUT will only offer  transnational courses where they satisfy all of the following key criteria:
  the course is offered in a country that   has been identified as a strategic priority by QUT's International Strategy 
 the course is offered in collaboration with a quality partner which has a proven reputation in their home country 
 the course will provide a strategic advantage for QUT that has long term multiple benefits 
 the course provides a commercial opportunity that is both economically viable and sustainable (including the identification of a viable cohort of students over the medium term (eg at least three years)
 the course is to be taught in English (unless a variation is formally approved by University Academic Board) 
 the quality of the student learning experience and the value of the award is the equivalent of the domestic offering.
QUT will not invest in, or establish or  lease campus assets outside Australia, or enter into franchising arrangements.Top 
3.5.2 Policy outcomes  
This policy is designed to:
  codify the University&rsquo;s  principles for transnational education, and
  provide faculties with a  framework for the development, approval, business management, implementation,  and quality assurance of transnational award courses. 
Top 
3.5.3 Definition of transnational award courses  
A course is considered to be transnational where the  QUT seal will be affixed to the award parchment and:
  a QUT  staff member travels to an overseas destination to teach the course, or
  particular offerings of the  course are targeted at cohorts of students resident in other countries, or 
  more than 50 percent of  the students admitted to a course  taught by distance methods are resident in  other countries. 
Transnational courses may be offered entirely  offshore or involve students attending QUT for a component of the course. Where a transnational course is a corporate  award course offered to employees of, or cohorts supported by, an external  organisation with whom a contract is in place, it is also subject to QUT&rsquo;s  policy for customised education (C/3.4).
Top 
3.5.4 Development and approval of transnational award  courses 
Faculties should establish a clear position  statement on transnational education and include any transnational aspirations  in their annual strategic plans. They  should have well-codified strategies for governing the development and delivery  of transnational courses. The development, approval and ongoing quality  assurance of all transnational corporate award courses is managed through the  faculty&rsquo;s governance structure for customised education (C/3.4).
QUT&rsquo;s transnational courses are expected to be  equivalent to courses offered domestically in terms of:
  strength of curriculum  design (C/4.2)
  entry requirements  including English language proficiency (E/4.1.2)
  access to library and  online resources
  access to student  support including development of information literacy and academic skills
  student expectations and  responsibilities (E/2.1) 
  academic standards.
The development of transnational courses should  follow the University guidelines for curriculum development and approval (C/4.1). However, given the high risk inherent in  transnational education, all transnational courses require approval by the  Vice-Chancellor and University Academic Board. A transnational course cannot be  advertised or offered by any party until both approvals have been given. Protocols for the development and approval  process for transnational courses are available on the Learning and Teaching Unit website.Top
3.5.5 Business management of transnational award  courses 
Management of transnational award courses occurs through  collaboration between the relevant faculty and the Office of Commercial  Services.&nbsp; In the case of transnational corporate  award courses, the faculty governance structures established under the customised  education policy (C/3.4)  apply.
The Office of Commercial Services is responsible for:
  oversight of contractual matters, including initial contract negotiation,  monitoring and annual evaluation of contract deliverables and routine reviews  of contracted programs prior to contract renewal
  oversight of financial arrangements including the development of business  plans, initial price setting, annual monitoring of expenditure against income,  and undertaking periodic reviews of financial viability.
The Division of Finance and  Resource Planning reviews the business plan and provides advice to the  Vice-Chancellor prior to approval.

3.5.6 Implementation and academic quality assurance of  transnational award courses 
All transnational award courses are subject  to the normal course quality assurance processes (see C/4.6). In addition, a separate quality assurance  process for transnational courses involves annual course reports and an audit  process.
(a) Annual course  quality assurance
All transnational award courses are subject to the  normal course quality assurance processes (C/4.6) including:
  the use of QUT&rsquo;s  approved student feedback instrument, the Learning Experience Survey (LEX) (C/4.7).&nbsp; Where use of an online instrument is not  possible (for example remote location of students or unavailability of web  access) a paper-based equivalent should be used
  the development of  annual Individual Course Reports (C/4.6) 
  additional reporting  processes where a transnational course is identified as &lsquo;low performing&rsquo; (C/4.6).
(b) Audit of transnational award courses
An audit of all transnational award courses is  conducted every four years by a non-faculty senior staff member or an external  auditor commissioned for the purpose. The  audit will include a comprehensive document review and interviews of staff and  students, both at QUT and at the location(s) where the course is taught. A  description of the audit process is available in the Protocols for Transnational Award Courses on the Learning and Teaching Unit website.
The auditor will provide a written report to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Learning and Teaching), who will refer matters raised to the relevant faculty or committee as follows:
  Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Advisory Committee (business and strategic issues) 
  University Teaching and Learning Committee and University Academic Board (academic issues) 
  the faculty offering the course (specific course academic and management issues)
  Divisional units (eg for student administration and student support issues). 
Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Advisory Committee and University  Teaching and Learning Committee will consider the issues and respond as  required within their terms of reference. An Action Plan will be developed  after each transnational audit for endorsement by University Academic Board and  Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Advisory Committee.  The Action Plan also will be referred to Audit and Risk Management  Committee for information and action as appropriate. University Academic Board and  Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Advisory Committee will receive progress reports annually on  the Action Plan for transnational award courses.
