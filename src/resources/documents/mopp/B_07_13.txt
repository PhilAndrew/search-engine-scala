Modification History 
7.13.1 Background 
This policy outlines principles relating to the re-engagement  of staff whose employment with QUT has ceased or is ceasing due to  voluntary or involuntary redundancy, or retirement following participation in  an Early Retirement Scheme (ERS).
The University has an expectation that a staff member&rsquo;s engagement  with QUT will cease on a permanent basis on taking a voluntary redundancy or an  ERS.
Top 
7.13.2 Application 
This policy applies to all academic, professional and senior  staff, excluding staff employed on a casual / sessional basis and staff on  pre-retirement employment arrangements (see B/7.5 ).
Top 
7.13.3 Definitions 
&quot;Redundancy&ldquo; means a situation where a position occupied  by an ongoing or fixed-term staff member is identified as surplus to the  University&rsquo;s requirements for reasons of an economic, technological, structural  or similar nature in accordance with the relevant certified agreement. A staff member  who accepts redundancy will receive a benefit according to the relevant staff  agreement.
&quot; Early Retirement Scheme (ERS)&rdquo; means a scheme initiated  by the University and approved by the Australian Taxation Office providing for  voluntary early retirement of a specified class of employees with a view to  rationalising or reorganising the operations of the employer. Staff aged under  65 at the date of retirement are entitled to special ERS tax provisions.

7.13.4 Re-engagement 
A staff member who is made redundant or accepts an ERS  benefit will not be eligible for continuing, fixed-term or casual / sessional employment  for a period of 12 months from the date of separation, unless approval in  exceptional circumstances is given by the Human Resources Director.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any  such instances will be reported to the Vice-Chancellor. This restriction  includes engagement as an independent consultant or under a company name or  partnership.
In determining the matter of exceptional circumstances, and  whether a staff member who has separated through redundancy or ERS may be re-engaged  within 12 months from the date of separation, the Human Resources Director will  take into account the following:
  the specific skills, experience and/or qualifications required for       performance of the duties of a particular position; 
  the steps that the organisational area has taken to fill the       employment opportunity (extent of advertising, etc); 
  whether there are any other suitable candidates for the position; 
  the type and level of benefit received by the staff member when       they separated from the University;&nbsp; 
  any other relevant factors. 
The staff member is responsible for understanding any  taxation implications (including penalties) which may arise as a result of re-engagement  following receipt of a redundancy or ERS benefit.
