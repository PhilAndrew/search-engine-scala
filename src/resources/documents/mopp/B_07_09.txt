Modification History 
7.9.1 Policy 
Professional staff and senior professional staff may undertake outside employment provided that they
  do so in a manner consistent with QUT's Code of Conduct (
B/8.1
  The requirements for an academic staff member undertaking outside work are detailed in the University's
  policy on outside work (
D/7.1
Outside employment is any paid work undertaken by a staff member in addition to their employment with
QUT. 
The obligations of staff undertaking outside employment are to ensure that:
the work does not interfere with the performance of QUT duties;
the work does not involve the use of University resources (except where otherwise permitted by
    University policy);
the work does not involve a conflict between the staff member's personal interests and the
    interests of the University (for information regarding conflict of interests and their management,
    refer to section 
B/8.1.6
of the Code of Conduct); and
the work does not involve a misuse of a staff member's position at the University.
Failure to meet these obligations may result in disciplinary action against the staff member.

7.9.2 Outside employment unrelated to a staff member's position 
Professional and senior professional staff are free to undertake other work not related to their duties
  or area of expertise without the need to seek prior approval, provided that the work does not result
in a breach by the staff member of any of their obligations under section 7.9.1 of this policy.
However, where outside employment may result in a breach of these obligations, the staff member must
  notify their supervisor and take appropriate steps to remedy the situation in conjunction with the
    supervisor. Appropriate steps may include:
management of a conflict of interest situation in accordance with QUT's Code of Conduct and
    the 
Procedures for Disclosure of Interests
subject to the agreement of the relevant head of school / department, alteration of working arrangements
    (eg reduced hours of work, period of leave) to ensure that work performance for QUT is not adversely
    affected by the outside employment commitments;
discontinuing the outside employment.

7.9.3 Outside employment related to a staff member's position 
Professional staff and senior professional staff must obtain approval from their supervisor prior
  to undertaking any outside employment related to their duties or area of expertise. Approval
  must only be granted where the supervisor is satisfied that:
the work does not result in a breach by the staff member of any of their obligations under section
    7.9.1 of this policy;
the staff member has demonstrated that appropriate risk management practices are in place for the
    type of work (such as insurance, registration or licensing requirements); and
there is no other risk to the University or its reputation arising from the outside employment.
Professional staff participation in University consultancy work
There may be occasions when a professional staff member participates in a consultancy provided by QUT
    to an external client, and may use University resources to do so. In this case, where approval
    is granted by the head of division or executive dean of faculty, a professional staff member may
    undertake a consultancy as part of their normal workload. In granting approval, relevant factors
    to take into account include those listed in 
D/7.1.8
for
  University outside work.
Payment for consultancy work undertaken by professional staff is made to QUT directly into an appropriate
  project account, and funds must be expended in accordance with University policies and procedures.
