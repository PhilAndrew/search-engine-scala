10.3.1 QUT academic dress 
The gowns and hoods worn at QUT graduation ceremonies stem from a distinctive 
  style of academic dress which emerged in the first universities in Europe in 
  the twelfth century. The style was influenced by the fact that masters and scholars 
  at that time were usually members of the clergy.
Colours have long been significant in denoting different academic disciplines 
  and, more recently, levels of scholastic achievement. Standard gowns of different 
  shape, length and sleeve design indicate the degrees of bachelor, master and 
  doctor. There are other robes that signify the office rather than the award 
  of the wearer, notably those of the Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor.
The gowns worn by the Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor of QUT retain a link 
  with the style of academic dress in the older English universities. However, 
  the QUT base material is a cooler wool blend rather than the traditional black 
  silk damask or faille, and the dark blue colour is in keeping with the corporate 
  identity of the University.
The embellishment used on the QUT ceremonial gowns (gold for the Chancellor, 
  silver for the Vice-Chancellor) gives a distinct Queensland identity. Whereas 
  traditional English festal robes are embellished with bullion braids in oak 
  leaf of plate lace patterns, the Queensland floral emblem (the Dendrobium bigibbum 
  or Cooktown Orchid) provides the theme for the QUT braids.
