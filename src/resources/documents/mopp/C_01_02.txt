Modification History 
The Learning and Teaching Plan  underpins and guides the direct planning activities of academic and support units in relation to the University's teaching goal and objectives by providing a formal framework for the University's commitment to the improvement of learning and teaching at QUT.
This framework, based on a rolling quinquennium, allows for incremental amendment to the overall strategy, making it responsive on an annual basis to changing needs and priorities within the institution and allowing for feedback from schools, faculties and other organisational units.
University Academic Board, through its University Teaching and Learning Committee, is responsible for developing and monitoring the strategy and the incorporated management plan objectives.
