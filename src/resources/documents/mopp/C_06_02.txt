6.2.1 Policy principles 
In line with QUT's vision and goals (see A/2.1 ), a key aim is to  support all commencing students to adjust successfully to study at QUT by  providing a strong transition experience -academically, socially and  administratively - according to their varied needs.
QUT is aware of the significant transitional challenges  facing first year students and acknowledges the diversity and changing social  and educational needs and aspirations of its entering cohorts. QUT believes  that a positive and involving First Year Experience (FYE), which connects new  learners with their teachers and peers in a community committed to learning,  provides the critical foundation for transition to later years' learning  success and career attainment and enhances student satisfaction, course experience  and retention.
At QUT, the FYE and successful transition of our students  is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility. QUT focuses on providing the best possible  experience for new students in an environment where they are supported to take  responsibility for their own learning, and to embrace an active role in  succeeding to their full potential (academically and personally) as new  learners in our University.
Therefore QUT will deliver a comprehensive, integrated  and coordinated approach to the FYE that: 
  is mediated through intentionally designed curricula and co-curricula 
  is facilitated by a quality learning environment and good teaching and support 
  is promoted and supported by all academic and professional staff interactions with students, where staff are developed, valued and rewarded for their FYE-focused perspective and partnerships 
  fosters easy access to services and programs that aid academic and social orientation, integration, and support 
  is appropriate to QUT's culture and creates a sense of belonging 
  is scholarly, evidence-based and enhanced by regular evaluation, and 
  is given a high priority by the University to ensure that the conditions that promote successful student transitions are appropriately resourced and are sustainable over time.

6.2.2 Orientation and transition
QUT recognises that students undertake learning transitions which may involve large-scale academic, social, and environmental change.   QUT aims to facilitate a positive and successful transition for all commencing students to their discipline(s) of study, campus, and learning environments through orientation processes which provide academic, social, administrative and geographic familiarisation with QUT and embrace the diversity of their previous experiences.
QUT considers orientation to be a process that occurs over time, both independently of the curriculum and embedded in the curriculum, and which incorporates the following activities:
  a process of academic and social integration to  facilitate learning engagement
  just-in-time information provision and timely  access to support services
  a  particular focus on critical time periods such as Orientation Week (&ldquo;O  Week&rdquo;).
Faculties and divisions are expected to base their  orientation activities on the good practice principles set out in the Protocols for Orientation and Transition (see Learning and Teaching Unit website).
'O week'
 'O Week' is recognised as the official commencement to the academic year  for commencing students, and is scheduled over specific days in the week  immediately preceding Week 1 of the standard teaching semester. Certain cohorts of students may be required  to participate in orientation activities prior to 'O Week'. Course specific  activities organised by faculties are considered to be compulsory for students,  and must therefore be designed to reach all commencing students.
  A University-wide approach to orientation is promoted through the  following:
  the  First Year Experience Committee is responsible for the coordination of a  University-wide approach to orientation, including the coordination of 'O  Week' 
  faculties,  divisions, and campuses, together with the Student Guild are responsible for  developing Orientation Plans to address transition issues relevant to  particular commencing student cohorts, and for ensuring adequate resourcing and  staff allocation, particularly over critical time periods 
  faculties,  divisions, and campuses report to the First Year Experience Committee twice a year  on activities undertaken, evaluation of activities, and plans for improvement.
