Modification History 
5.1.1 Project planning 
The University signals its intention to undertake a major or minor capital work in the Asset Management Plan (see 
H/2.1.2
). Until a project has reached the stage of appearing on the Plan, it has no official status. The process and timeframe for advancing projects onto the Asset Management Plan align with the University's annual strategic planning processes. 
The planning for and delivery of a new capital project, such as a major refurbishment or new building, involves a number of stages that bring together expertise from the Division of Finance and Resource Planning (see 
H/2.1.3
), Facilities Management (see 
H/2.1.4
) and the relevant committees (see 
H/2.1.6
). Facilities Management (Capital Works Section) is responsible for the planning and delivery phases, with strategic oversight by the Division of Finance and Resource Planning.

5.1.2 Project delivery 
The delivery phase can be straightforward or involve a series of iterations prior to the design being approved and matched to budget allocations in the Asset Management Plan. Costings are checked throughout the process, particularly prior to final approval for the project to proceed. Capital works projects fall into two main categories as follows 
University funded works 
which are separately identified as a major project in the Asset Management Plan or which are included, but not necessarily identified separately, in the minor works funding allocation within the Plan (see 
H/5.2
Faculty / division funded minor works 
which typically alter or extend existing spaces to accommodate changing needs. Only works which are consistent with the Asset Management Plan and University policy are approved to proceed (see 
H/5.3
Central to the performance of the University's Asset Management Plan is the primary need to produce space which provides the correct environment for the users of the space. To assist in achieving this aim, a sequence of Project Control Groups and User Groups has been implemented to assist in the project planning and delivery (see 
H/4.3
