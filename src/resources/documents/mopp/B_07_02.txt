Modification History 
7.2.1 Staff identification cards 
It is University policy that each staff member carry a staff identification card.
Staff identification cards comprise a photograph of the staff member, typed  details of their name and an expiry date. The card ensures that staff can easily establish their  identity when working after hours. The  card is also required for borrowing library resources, obtaining a QUT-Access  username and password, and providing authorised personnel with swipe access to  rooms or buildings which use the electronic card access system.
  Cards are issued by Student Centres on each campus.
Further information is available on the Student Services website.

7.2.2 Uniforms 
All full-time staff (on-going and fixed-term) who have been engaged for a  period of six months or more in routine buildings and grounds maintenance,  minor works construction or cleaning activities must wear a uniform provided by  the University.
Uniforms are optional for staff engaged in the management or direct  supervision of these activities. However, these staff must display their staff identification  card when engaged in activities outside of their office or work area.
Further details are available from Facilities Management.

7.2.3 Return of QUT property and cancellation of access 
Upon cessation of employment at QUT or when transferring to a different  position within the University, staff are required to return University  property and cancel access / authorities to buildings, computer accounts, etc. 
A Checklist for Staff Transferring / Terminating  Employment
must be completed and signed by the relevant staff member and  head of organisational area on the staff member's last working day, and held by  the organisational area for a period of three years.
Copies of the checklist and further details are available from 
  Human Resources website.

7.2.4 Absence from normal duties on University business 
Staff may need to be absent from QUT on University business. Applications  for such absences which involve more than 10 working days during semester or  more than 15 working days outside of teaching sessions must be approved by the  executive dean of faculty / head of division.
Applications must be submitted to the executive dean of faculty / head of  division in the format required for professional development program  applications (see 
B/12.7
for academic staff and 
B/12.8
for  professional staff). The executive dean of faculty / head of division will  refer the application to the relevant Professional Development Committee if  necessary.
In addition, all staff travelling under these  conditions and proposing to attend meetings, conferences, seminars etc must  complete a travel requisition form (see 
G/5.5
for details  of approval and financial procedures).
