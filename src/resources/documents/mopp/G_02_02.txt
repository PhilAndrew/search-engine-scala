Modification History 
2.2.1 Safe custody and banking of collections 
Student Business Services, through its Campus Cashiers, is responsible for the receipting of money
for the University on each campus.
Other collection points at “Point of Sale” may be set up with the prior approval of the Associate Director, Accounting Services.
The officer in charge of each unit approved as
  a collection point for University monies is responsible for the safe custody of such monies until deposited
  into the authorised bank accounts of the University.
As a general principle, all collections must be deposited daily to University bank accounts and deposited
  intact except in exceptional circumstances. On no account should University monies be intermingled
  with personal money of staff, or applied for private purposes, even on a temporary basis.
Detailed procedures for the receipting of funds can be found in the 
Financial
  Management Practice and Procedures Manual
(Chapter 2).

2.2.2 Cash shortages and surpluses 
The Associate Director, Financial Operations, and Associate Director, Student Business
  Services, are required to investigate all material losses in accordance with  
Financial
  and Performance Management Standard 2009 Sections 21 and 22, and to make a written report and recommendations to the  Director, Corporate Finance. Should such a report indicate that a loss may have been due to an offence under
  the Criminal Code or any other Act or law, the Director, Corporate Finance  is required to notify the
  police and the Auditor-General in writing. Where official misconduct by a member of the University
  is indicated, the Director, Corporate Finance  is required to notify the Registrar who shall notify
the Crime and Misconduct Commission.
Approval to write off cash shortages is in accordance
  with the delegated authorities to write off assets – see 
Appendix

The Associate Director, Accounting Services ensures that all material shortages are recorded in the Record of Material
Losses (Cash).
