9.3.1 Role of Student Ombudsman
The Student Ombudsman is  responsible to the Registrar for maintaining procedures for the formal and  informal management of grievances in student matters. The Student Ombudsman  also acts as a catalyst for innovation and improvement in standards, practices  and procedures relating to undergraduate and postgraduate coursework students.
The primary functions of the  Student Ombudsman are:
  to provide advice to students and staff encountering difficulties associated with student-related rules, policies and procedures; 
  to advise the Registrar on academic and administrative matters affecting students and strategies for reducing the number of formal appeals lodged by students; 
  to participate in the University's procedures for resolution of student related grievances; 
  to undertake formal investigation of student-related complaints which can not be resolved by other means; 
  to encourage and facilitate improvements in the quality of the University's administrative, teaching, learning and student service processes and promote input by staff, students and interested third parties into development of University policies.
The Student Ombudsman is an ex  officio member of Academic Policy and Procedures Committee ( 
E/1.1 ) and Appeals Committee ( E/1.2 ).
The Student Ombudsman will  normally serve for a fixed term of three years, but this may be subject to  renewal. The Student Ombudsman reports annually to the Vice-Chancellor, via the  Registrar, on activities and matters handled each academic year.

9.3.2 Status of Student  Ombudsman
  The University recognises that  the Student Ombudsman must maintain neutrality, independence and  confidentiality in performing the role. The Student Ombudsman has direct access  to all levels of the University, including senior officers such as the  Vice-Chancellor and Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), as well as executive  deans of faculty and heads of school, academic and administrative staff.
  There will be occasions when  there could reasonably be a perception that a conflict of interest arises which  is sufficient to compromise the Student Ombudsman's independence and  impartiality (eg where a matter arises from an academic activity or  administrative decision in which the Student Ombudsman has had a direct  involvement). In such cases the matter will be referred to the Registrar for  resolution. The provisions of the University's Code of Conduct for staff ( B/8.1 ) also apply.
