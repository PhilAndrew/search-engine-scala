2.2.1 Planning and management principles 
QUT's strategic planning and management is based on the following  principles
a) strategic planning directed towards the attainment of the University's  vision and goals. The University operates a strategic planning cycle which  involves three major levels as follows
  QUT Institutional Plan which sets the directions for the entire       University and&nbsp; articulates major       University-level priorities, strategies and targets 
  planning and budgeting for organisational units (faculties,       divisions, institutes)&nbsp; 
  individual staff performance planning and review in the       context of University and organisational unit plans. 
b) risk management which contributes to the achievement of the  University's corporate objectives through processes, structures and culture  that is directed towards effective management of potential opportunities and  adverse effects (A/2.5)
c) resource management to ensure that resources are applied effectively  and utilised efficiently in executing the University's strategic plans
d) accountability via reporting on plan outcomes (see A/2.2.7 below) and  the review of organisational units (A/2.3)
e) devolution of responsibility within the framework of approved  plans (see A/2.2.8 below)
f) continuous improvement of planning and management processes (see A/2.2.9 below).

2.2.2 Responsibilities 
Council
Council approves the QUT Institutional Plan following endorsement by  relevant committees.
Vice-Chancellor
The Vice-Chancellor develops the QUT IP and is responsible for faculty,  division and institute planning. The Vice-Chancellor will regularly seek advice  from Planning and Resources Committee and Vice-Chancellor's Advisory Committee  in the execution of this responsibility.
Executive deans of faculty / heads of division / institute directors
Executive deans of faculty / heads of division / institute directors are  responsible for leadership and management of their organisational areas,  including
  preparation       of one-year faculty / division / institute action plans and three-year       budgets 
  monitoring       the implementation of plans
  negotiating       and working with relevant areas to achieve the University-level       priorities, strategies and targets outlined in the Institutional Plan&nbsp; 
  determining       the nature of operational planning and budgeting to be used within their       own faculty, division or institute. 
Executive deans of faculty / heads of divisions / institute directors  also are responsible for reporting annually on achievement of faculty, division  and institute plans.
Executive Director, Finance and Resource Planning
The Executive Director, Finance and Resource Planning coordinates an  annual report on the Institutional Plan each calendar year, which informs the  QUT Annual Report (A/2.2.7).
Senior managers
Managers at all levels are accountable for risk  management in accordance with the University's risk management policy (see A/2.5 ).
Top 
2.2.3 QUT Institutional Plan 
Institutional planning occurs every five years, or more frequently if  required. It is led by the Vice-Chancellor with the active participation of  Council, Planning and Resources Committee and the Vice-Chancellor's Advisory  Committee. The process is informed by a comprehensive assessment of the  University's future external and internal environments and relies on  consultation with staff and other stakeholders. The resultant QUT Institutional  Plan sets the overall long-term direction for the University as a whole and  articulates major University-level priorities, strategies and targets.
Top 
2.2.4 Faculty, division and institute planning and  budgeting 
Faculty, division and institute planning and budgeting processes involve  the following steps
  Executive       deans of faculty /heads of division / institute directors meet with the       Vice-Chancellor and Executive Director, Finance and Resource Planning to       report on progress against existing plans, to discuss the key priorities       for the coming year, and to negotiate any high level financial or       strategic issues for inclusion in their plans and budgets. The Deputy       Vice-Chancellor (Academic) participates in faculty meetings, and the       Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation) participates in       institute meetings
  Faculties,       divisions and institutes are annually provided with a planning and budget       package which includes 
    the        QUT Institutional Plan, including University-level priorities, strategies        and targets 
    guidelines        for the preparation of faculty, division and institute plans
    the        budget framework for the following three years 
    the        corporate-level risk assessment.
  Faculties       / divisions / institutes submit three-year detailed budgets from which the       University budget is prepared for consideration by Planning and Resources       Committee and recommendation to Council for approval
  Faculties,       divisions and institutes prepare one-year action plans within the context       of any changes to the QUT Institutional Plan, and/or changes to strategic       directions such as an outcome of a corporate review. Risk assessments and       reporting are undertaken in conjunction with these plans. Plans will       specify the organisational area's individual priorities&nbsp; and should clearly show how each faculty       / division / institute will implement or execute their strategies aligned       to the Institutional Plan. Plans also should respond to any revisions to       the faculty / division / institute risk assessment. Institutes are       expected to consult with participating faculties during the development of       institute plans.
A detailed Planning Timetable, issued at the beginning of each year,  provides the key actions and dates for the planning and budgeting process in  that year. The usual sequence for the key actions in the process is detailed on  the Planning and Budget website.
Policies and procedures relating to the University's budgeting process  are in G/4.1 and the Financial Management Practice and Procedures Manual.
Top 
2.2.5 Individual staff performance planning and review 
Individual staff actively participate in planning processes within their  organisational unit. Faculty / division / institute planning is also  inter-related to individual staff performance and review activities. Staff  should pursue performance and development paths consistent with the direction  of their faculty, division or institute as articulated in the relevant plans  and this is formalised through performance planning and review processes (see B/9).
Top 
2.2.6 Accountability and reporting
Annual reporting
The Marketing and Communication Department produces the QUT Annual  Report, which gives an overview of QUT and its operations for each calendar  year (see F/4.1).
The Executive Director, Finance and Resource Planning coordinates an  annual report on the Institutional Plan each calendar year which informs the  QUT Annual Report. Following consideration of the annual report by Planning and  Resources Committee and Council early the following year, the University-level  priorities, strategies and targets may be reviewed or updated as required, by  mid-year, in order to inform the next planning cycle of faculties, divisions  and institutes.
Faculties, divisions and institutes provide a formal annual report at  the end of each calendar year, building on the progress report provided to the  Vice-Chancellor in the planning meeting (see A/2.2.4 above). These reports are  provided to the Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Advisory Committee, inform the QUT Annual  Report and any review of the institutional plan.
Reporting on key performance indicators
QUT's key performance indicators (KPIs) provide ongoing feedback on the  University's achievement of its vision and goals and are widely used for  communicating the University's performance externally, for example to the  Queensland Parliament through the QUT Annual Report. Progress reports on KPIs  are regularly provided to Vice-Chancellor's Advisory Committee, Planning and  Resources Committee, and Council. Further information may be obtained from the  Division of Finance and Resource Planning (Planning and  Budget website).
Evaluation of strategic planning processes
A comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency and  effectiveness of the University's strategic planning processes and the  appropriateness of the results achieved is conducted regularly through the  corporate reviews system (A/2.3).
Top 
2.2.7 Devolution of responsibility 
Within the framework of approved plans, University policies and  procedures, and allocated budgets, managers are given a high degree of  flexibility in decision-making. This devolution of responsibility recognises  that managers are responsible for management of risks and the achievement of  plans in an often dynamic environment and that operational management decisions  are most appropriately made at the organisational unit level.
Top 
2.2.8 Continuous improvement of planning and  management processes  
The University is committed to the ongoing  review and continuous improvement of its planning and management processes.  This is provided through a thorough review of processes at least every five  years. In addition, each year the Vice-Chancellor seeks advice from  Vice-Chancellor's Advisory Committee on potential improvements. Major changes  to processes are subject to approval through Planning and Resources Committee  and Council.
