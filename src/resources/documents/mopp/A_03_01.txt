3.1.1 Role and composition of Council 
QUT Council is the governing  body of the University, ultimately responsible for ensuring its proper and  effective management and operation.
Composition, membership,  powers and responsibilities of QUT Council are governed by the Queensland University of Technology    Act 1998 ( QUT  Act ) . Procedures for meetings, dealing with business in  Council, and establishment of committees are included in Council Procedure 1  - Committees (see Appendix 2).  Procedures  for the nomination of prospective Council members and election of a Chancellor  and Deputy Chancellor are included in Council Procedures  (see Appendix 2).
QUT Council comprises senior  members of the professions for which QUT prepares graduates; appointees from  higher education, government, commerce and industry; elected staff, students  and members of Alumni, and the University's chief executive officer. A full  list of members of QUT Council is available from the Council web page.

3.1.2 Role of the Chancellor 
The Chancellor is the formal  head of the University by virtue of being the chair of the governing body. As  such, the Chancellor is responsible for the efficient operation of Council and  for providing leadership to ensure it carries out its responsibilities in an  effective manner. This includes:
  articulating and reinforcing the role   of Council and its members, thus ensuring the demarcation between Council's role and management is well understood; 
  ensuring mechanisms are in place and appropriate support is provided to members to assist them in performing their role and to promote Council working as a team; and 
  assessing the performance of Council, its members and committees on a regular basis. 
The Chancellor, on behalf of  Council, is responsible for the following:
  determining the Vice-Chancellor's performance agreement and the process for review and assessment of his or her performance;
  providing advice and support to the Vice-Chancellor;
  authorising arrangements for the       management of the University during periods when the position of       Vice-Chancellor is vacant or in transition.
The Chancellor, in addition to  the role as chair of Council, participates in committees as determined by the  membership of Council and other University committees.
The Chancellor in consultation  with relevant senior officers is responsible for recommending Council members  to fill positions on Council committees and panels as required.
The Chancellor has a  significant ceremonial role, including graduation ceremonies and attending  University or related activities as either guest of honour, presenter or  University representative. Some of these activities may be delegated to the  Deputy Chancellor or another member of Council.
The Chancellor also has an  outreach role, which not only includes the ceremonial role outlined above, but  has a broader dimension in representing the University in the wider community.  In particular, the cultivation of 'friends' of the University is an important  activity, whether these be individuals, companies or governments. This includes  approaching and sponsoring potential Council members as required.
Further details relating to  the position of Chancellor are available on the Council web page .

3.1.3 QUT Council Charter 
QUT Council is committed to  the achievement of the University's aims and ambitions within an operational  framework that embodies the principles of good governance and has adopted the QUT Council Charter to guide  these objectives.

3.1.4 Confidentiality of Council deliberations 
Council deliberations on any issue are confidential to Council members, although non-confidential papers and minutes of Council meetings are freely available for perusal in  Governance Services at Gardens Point Campus.
Top 
3.1.5 Delegation of authority 
Council is empowered to  establish committees and to delegate power to committees or officers of the  University. While Council is ultimately responsible for the management and  operation of QUT, it has delegated authority to the chief executive officer,  the Vice-Chancellor, and to various senior administrators of QUT for much of  the day to day management of the University. Council has also established a  number of committees (see Appendix 8 ),  some of which have been authorised to make decisions in respect of prescribed  policy and procedural matters. See the Schedule of Authorities and Delegations ( Appendix 3 )  for details.

3.1.6 Life Fellowship of QUT

Council web page

  of Study (Section 6: Honorary degrees) (see 
Appendix
1(b)
), and on recommendation from Chancellor&rsquo;s Committee.
Each year the Vice-Chancellor  requests Council members, executive deans of faculty, and key staff to make  recommendation regarding possible candidates for an honorary doctorate.  Recommendations must be accompanied by a brief curriculum vitae and a  description of the recommended candidate's distinguished service to the  community or to QUT or to scholarship (see guidelines on Governance  Services website).
Recommendations will be forwarded to Chancellor&rsquo;s Committee which will recommend candidates
  for the award of Doctor of the University (DUniv) to Council.
