Modification History 
6.1.1 Definitions 
Maintenance of University property is categorised in the following three ways 
preventive maintenance - ie preventing or reducing the frequency of failure by periodically maintaining plant, equipment or fabric 
corrective maintenance - ie work carried out in order to restore and preserve University property 
backlog maintenance - ie corrective and preventive maintenance which should already have been completed but has been deferred due to a lack of maintenance funding.

6.1.2 Preventive maintenance 
QUT's policy on preventive maintenance generally requires that regular periodic maintenance be carried out on systems and equipment according to the following priority levels: 
Priority One 
- where systems are required to be preventively maintained under specific legislation, industry regulations, local by-laws, Australian Standards etc (eg fire detection and prevention systems, cooling tower water treatment, passenger lifts, electrical appliance testing, fume cupboards, emergency and exit lighting) 
Priority Two 
- where there is responsibility on QUT to properly maintain plant and equipment for the safety and well-being of the University community (eg external lighting, filter replacements) 
Priority Three 
- where strong economic arguments exist for preventively maintaining plant, equipment and fabric (eg external painting programs, roof cleaning, window systems, bulk fluorescent tube replacement, road sweeping). 
The extent to which preventive maintenance is carried out on plant, equipment and fabric depends on mandatory requirements, the likely consequences (economic, functional etc) of failure to a particular system, the potential risks to staff and students, and the availability of maintenance funds.

6.1.3 Maintenance funding 
The University has recognised a need to adequately fund corrective and preventive maintenance to prevent further growth in backlog (deferred) maintenance and to reduce the risk of safety incidents and disruption to University activities. 
A formula funding approach to resourcing maintenance has been adopted by the University and is based on asset replacement values (ARV) of its buildings and services infrastructure. QUT policy is to achieve a minimum funding rate of 1.2% of ARV in progressive increases over a number of years as permitted by the University budget. 
Maintenance problems should be reported to the Facilities Help Desk on Ext 83000. The 
Facilities Management
Web Page provides further information.

6.1.4 Backlog (deferred) maintenance 
Backlog (deferred) maintenance is treated as an essential part of the Asset Management Plan and is integrated with the strategic planning and delivery of the renovations and building developments for all campuses. Funding for deferred maintenance has been recognised as a high priority of the University and will be derived from capital funding sources, subject to annual review (see 
H/2.1.2
Facilities Management (Operations Section) carries out detailed audits of building services and fabric every five years. These audits provide an opportunity to update the University's register of deferred maintenance works. 
The priority order of works to be carried out is based on a structured risk assessment process which measures the probability and consequences of safety and compliance incidents, disruption to the activities of the University and the financial implications of delay of works. 
Minor works associated with growth in staffing and student load will be the responsibility of faculties and divisions 
The planned annual program of major backlog maintenance works is submitted for approval each year to the Director, Facilities Management, subject to allocation of budget within the Asset Management Plan. 
Top 
6.1.5 Grounds maintenance 
Responsibility for the effective and efficient management of the University's external environment rests with Facilities Management and is administered through Campus Services. New landscaping work will be informed by the landscape master plan prepared for each of the University's campuses.
