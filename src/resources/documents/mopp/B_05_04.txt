Modification History 
5.4.1 Policy statement 
Recognition and reward of the accomplishments of staff is essential to the  motivation, attraction and retention of quality staff. QUT is committed to  recognising and rewarding such accomplishments which further its vision and  goals. 
In line with this commitment, QUT provides academic staff with access to a  promotion scheme which focuses on demonstrated accomplishment across the areas  of teaching, research and scholarship, and service. These areas cover the  diversity of academic activities and recognise disciplinary differences.
Staff are guided and assisted in career development and opportunities for  promotion through the University's Performance Planning and Review for Academic  Staff process (PPR-AS) (see B/9.2 ).
Top 
5.4.2 Definitions 
For the purposes of this policy:
  &ldquo;head of school&rdquo; means the head of a school  or equivalent and includes portfolio directors in Creative Industries and the Manager, Oodgeroo Unit
  &ldquo;executive dean&rdquo; means the executive dean of  a faculty or equivalent
  &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; means faculty or equivalent
  In the case of Indigenous applicants in the  Oodgeroo Unit, references to the executive dean will read &ldquo;Deputy-Vice  Chancellor (Academic)&rdquo;. For the purpose of the appeals provision (B/5.4.19),  references to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) will read  &ldquo;Vice-Chancellor&rdquo;
Top 
5.4.3 Eligibility 
To apply for promotion from Level A  to Level B, an academic staff member must:
  hold an on-going or fixed-term appointment  (which may be either full-time or part-time), and
  have a minimum period of service with QUT of one  year at the time of application.
Fixed-term appointees are eligible  to be promoted within the term of their contract.
Research only academic staff at Level A are eligible to apply for promotion.
Sessional academic staff members  are ineligible for promotion.
Top 
5.4.4 Timing of application 
Promotion to Level B will occur  through the PPR-AS process. Eligible academic staff members may submit an application for  promotion to Level B at a time agreed by the staff member and their supervisor.  Under this process, promotion is outcomes-focussed, and applications do not  need to be linked to either the timing of the individual's PPR-AS cycle or the  applicant's incremental progression date.
Top 
5.4.5 Approving authority 
Promotion to Level B will be  approved by the executive dean, on the recommendation of the head of school.
Top 
5.4.6 Confidentiality 
All material and deliberations relating  to promotion applications will be treated in the strictest confidence by all  participants in the promotion process. It is acknowledged that materials and  information relating to the promotion application may have to be referred to a  review panel in the event that an appeal is lodged by the staff member.
Top 
5.4.7 Role of PPR Supervisor 
All academic staff members have a  supervisor for the purposes of the PPR-AS process. Supervisors  will work with prospective applicants to develop a Promotion Plan through the PPR-AS process.  Supervisors are expected to provide guidance, support and feedback to  prospective applicants for promotion to Level B.
Top 
5.4.8 Qualifications and equivalent accreditation or  standing 
To be considered for promotion to  Level B, applicants will normally have a masters or doctoral qualification in  the relevant discipline area. Applicants who do not possess such qualifications  will be required to make a case to the executive dean for equivalent  accreditation or standing. 
The prospective applicant and  supervisor should establish the requisite qualifications or equivalent standing  as part of the Promotion  Plan.
Guidelines for Judging  Equivalent Accreditation or Standing are available on the Human Resources website.
Top 
5.4.9 Criteria for promotion 
Applicants for promotion will be  assessed on their achievement in respect of the criteria for promotion to Level  B, which are:
  teaching
  research and scholarship, and
  service. 
The level of attainment and  examples of accomplishment required for promotion to each level are provided in  the table entitled Criteria  for Promotion available at Academic  Promotion on the Human  Resources website.
Evidence of accomplishment in all  three criteria will normally be required except where an applicant is seeking  promotion as a Research or Teaching Intensive staff member.
An applicant for promotion is not expected to demonstrate  achievement in all of  the examples provided in the table Criteria for Promotion available on the Human Resources website. Furthermore, these examples do not represent an exhaustive list of achievement  for each level and the nature of achievement may vary based on disciplinary  norms.
Research  or teaching intensive applicants
Applications for promotion from  staff who do not contribute in all three criteria will be allowed for staff  members in research or teaching intensive roles. Under this arrangement, with  agreement by the supervisor, head of school and executive dean, a prospective  applicant may wish to focus their activities and achievements in one criterion (either teaching or  research and scholarship). A research or teaching intensive applicant must  address at least one of the two remaining criteria in their Promotion Plan and  application.
Top 
5.4.10  Promotion Plan 
In conjunction with the relevant  PPR-AS supervisor, a staff member seeking promotion from Level A to Level B  will, through the PPR-AS process, develop a Promotion Plan detailing the necessary  achievements, performance standards and a timeline. The Promotion Plan will be  completed in addition to the PPR-AS Activity Statement, which is prepared as  part of the annual PPR-AS cycle.
The Promotion Plan will be aligned  with the Criteria  for Promotion to Level B. While applicants are expected to demonstrate  achievement in all three promotion criteria (with the exception of research and  teaching intensive applicants), the activities and achievements outlined in a  staff member&rsquo;s Promotion Plan will reflect the agreed areas of interest for the  applicant, and should take into account:
  professional and disciplinary norms 
  differences in the opportunity provided or available  for career development, and
  the importance of quality not just quantity of  accomplishment. 
In the case of part-time staff,  quantity of output should be considered on a pro-rata basis. However, the same  quality of accomplishment as full-time staff will be expected.
The Promotion Plan, and any changes  to the plan that may arise from periodical review(s), will be agreed and  endorsed by the staff member&rsquo;s PPR supervisor, head of school and executive  dean. 
Top 
5.4.11 Promotion application 
Applications must include:
  a copy of the staff member's Promotion Plan, as  developed through the PPR-AS process, and
  evidence that achievements identified in the  Promotion Plan have been met.
Applications must be endorsed by the head of school  and then forwarded to the executive dean for approval.
Top
5.4.12 Indigenous staff members
Indigenous staff members may  request that the supervisor, head of school and executive dean take advice on Indigenous-related  issues prior to developing the Promotion Plan or at the time of assessing an  application. The initial point of contact for such advice is the Indigenous  Employment and Strategy Officer (Human Resources Department).
Top
5.4.13 Referral to executive dean
 Where the staff member and  supervisor are unable to reach agreement on the content of the Promotion Plan  or application, or the head of school does not endorse an application for promotion,  the staff member may refer the matter to the executive dean.
 Top 
 5.4.14 Notification and feedback
 The executive dean will inform the  applicant verbally, then in writing, of the outcome of their application. An  unsuccessful applicant will be invited to meet with the relevant executive dean  and head of school or the PPR supervisor to receive feedback on their  application.
 Top
 5.4.15 Effective date of promotionThe effective date of promotion for successful applicants to Level B is the date of approval by the executive dean.
 Top
 5.4.16 Promotion while on probationWhere a successful applicant is serving a probationary period, the remaining period of probation will be waived and the appointment confirmed at Level B. If any special conditions attached to the applicant’s probation are not met at the time the promotion is approved, then these conditions will continue to apply through PPR-AS. For example, a requirement that the staff member continues to make progress towards a higher degree may be included as an agreed goal in the PPR Activity Statement.
 Top
 5.4.17 Use of title for research staffApplicants who are promoted to Level B, and who are appointed to research-only positions, will use the title of research fellow or senior research associate. The executive dean will determine the appropriate title.
 Top
 5.4.18 Resignation prior to completion of the promotion  process
 Where an applicant for promotion  tenders their resignation from the University prior to the promotion being  approved, their application will be regarded as withdrawn.
 5.4.19 Appeals
 A person whose promotion  application is not successful may make an application for review.
 The staff member must submit  reasons for the review, in writing, to the Human Resources Director within 10  working days of receiving written advice of the executive dean&rsquo;s decision.
 The Human Resources Director will  convene a panel comprising:
   one senior academic of the University,  determined by the Human Resources Director in consultation with the Deputy  Vice-Chancellor (Academic), and
   a nominee of the staff representatives on the  Academic Consultative Committee after consultation with the staff member.
 The panel will consider the  application for review, and may interview the staff member, supervisor, head of  school or executive dean. The panel will report its findings and, where  relevant, make recommendation/s to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) via  the Human Resources Director.
 The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic)  will make a decision on the matter, and report that decision in writing to the  staff member, the executive dean and the head of school. The decision of the  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) will be final and there will be no further  right of appeal.
