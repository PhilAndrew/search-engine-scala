4.5.1 Policy  principles 
All units must have an associated unit outline,  approved by the relevant faculty academic board (see C/3.1.3 and C/4.1), before the unit can  be offered. A unit outline provides information to current and prospective  students and other stakeholders, and is also used for approval of the  unit. 
Top 
4.5.2 Unit  outlines 
A unit outline is prepared by the Unit  Coordinator (see B/3.5.6)  and must conform to the following requirements:
  The unit outline must incorporate a description  of the rationale, aim, learning outcomes, learning and teaching approaches,  content, assessment, required resources and synopsis of the unit in accordance  with the proforma on the Learning and Teaching Unit website. 
  Unit outlines are written in student-centred  language, and are reviewed and revised when improvements or changes are  required as a result of student evaluations (see C/4.7 ). 
  The information provided in unit outlines is a  general description of the unit which is unlikely to change between offerings  unless significant changes are made to the unit. 
  A single unit outline is used for all offerings  of the unit including:
      where  a unit is offered on different campuses under the same unit code 
      where  a unit is offered to different cohorts of students (eg internal and external)  under the same unit code 
      where  a unit is split across teaching periods.
Top 
4.5.3 Publishing  dates for unit outlines 
Unit  outlines must be available to students at the time of publication of the  timetable for the corresponding academic period. Deadlines for publishing unit  outlines are therefore the same as those for the timetable (see E/5.1.5):
  Semester 1 unit outlines -       Week 11 of preceding semester (Semester 2) 
  Semester 2 unit outlines -       Week 11 of preceding semester (Semester 1) 
  Summer Program unit       outlines - Week 11 of preceding semester (Semester 2) (to correspond with       the beginning of Summer Program enrolment) 
Changes to published unit outlines must be  kept to a minimum to avoid any adverse impact on students. Changes can be made  to unit outlines after publication only in the following circumstances:
  Academic  changes to the unit outline which do not alter the unit title or learning  outcomes can be made up to the date of opening of classes for registration by  students (see E/5.1.6) and must be approved through the usual faculty approval process (see C/4.1).
  Academic  changes to unit outlines proposed after the opening of classes for registration  must be approved by the relevant faculty academic board and only in exceptional  circumstances. Administrative changes,  as defined in the protocols for unit outlines (see Learning and Teaching Unit website),  can be made up to the commencement of semester.
  Any  change to the unit requirements as described in the unit outline made after the  commencement of semester requires agreement of the students taking the unit,  approval of the head of school, and approval of the change to the unit outline  through the usual faculty approval process (see C/4.1).
Top 
4.5.4 Additional  unit information 
The Unit Coordinator is responsible for providing additional  information to students enrolled in the unit by the first week or activity of  the relevant teaching period. This additional  information must be consistent with the unit outline and not alter intent or  detail of the unit outline, and must include the following details:
  due dates of all assessment items, any specific  guidance to the student on the type and nature of the assessment items, and  details of the criteria, performance standards, and weighting that will be used  to judge the assessment (see C/5.1 ) 
  procedures to be used in determining the overall  grade including, where appropriate, a statement of any item/s for which a pass  is required in order to gain an overall pass in the unit 
  advice to students on a unit's status as a designated  unit for a particular course 
  advice on how to access information on 
    procedures  for reviewing the mark for an assessment item 
    procedures  to facilitate feedback on progressive assessment during the teaching  period 
    the  University's policy on academic dishonesty (see E/2.1) 
  feedback to students on changes to the unit as a  result of previous student evaluations of the unit and/or teaching 
  details of lecture and tutorial topics and  specific information on field trips or other unit requirements if required (see C/3.1.7)
  full details of any costs to students, including  options for students in cases of financial hardship
  approved variation to assessment protocols.
Protocols and guidelines relating to unit  outlines and additional unit information are available on the Learning and Teaching Unit website.

4.5.5 Responsibility for teaching units 
Faculties are expected to consult with other discipline  areas when establishing a new or changed course to determine which area is most  appropriate to teach particular units.  Units which provide a discipline base are most appropriately taught by  whichever school or discipline area is recognised as most expert in the  discipline. The professional application of a discipline, however, may be best  taught by the school or discipline area responsible for the course. Top 
4.5.6 Unit  viability and completion
QUT monitors unit viability and  unit completion to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of teaching  activity.
Unit completion is measured by an  index which illustrates the extent to which students successfully completed a  unit attempted for the year in question.  The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Learning and Teaching) is responsible for  monitoring unit completion data and advising University Academic Board as  necessary. Schools are responsible for  establishing discipline benchmarks in recognition of variations in completion  rates across disciplines.
An executive dean of faculty may  choose to cancel any class in any unit where the number of enrolments in that  class is not considered to be viable (normally a commencing enrolment of less  than 12).
