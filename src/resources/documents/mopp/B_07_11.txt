7.11.2 Maximum Coverage 
All staff members who have an appointment of 12 months or more are eligible
for maximum superannuation coverage.
The maximum superannuation coverage for staff members in UniSuper requires that QUT contribute the equivalent
  of 17% of gross salary. Staff members can choose a contribution rate of between
  0% and 7% of gross salary subject to the UniSuper Trust Deed, with 7% of gross
  salary being the default rate.
Inclusion in Maximum Coverage
A staff member who is not normally eligible may apply for maximum coverage, provided that the staff member's position is funded from external sources and provides for maximum coverage.

7.11.3 Minimum Coverage 
Staff members who do not qualify for maximum superannuation coverage are provided minimum superannuation
  coverage.
Minimum superannuation coverage requires that QUT pays the equivalent of the contribution required
  to be paid under the 
Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act 1992
(Cwth). The current
  level of the Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contribution is the equivalent of 9% of ordinary times earnings. 
From  1 January 2011, SG contributions extend to staff  members who
