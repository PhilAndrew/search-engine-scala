4.3.1 Policy principles 
QUT is committed to developing  graduates who can contribute effectively as citizens, leaders in the wider  community, and competent professionals within their chosen discipline.  Employers of QUT graduates need to be confident that graduates will demonstrate  employment-related skills as well as disciplinary expertise and be capable of  dealing effectively with new situations. Graduates, in turn, need to be  confident in their understanding and articulation of their capability  development, and their preparedness for a challenging and dynamic future.&nbsp; 
QUT is therefore  committed to the following principles for graduate capabilities:
  Each graduate from an  undergraduate or postgraduate degree is expected to have developed graduate  capabilities of a kind and level appropriate to their award 
  Graduates from an  undergraduate degree will demonstrate the graduate capabilities listed in  C/4.3.3 below 
  All postgraduate courses  will enable students to extend their graduate capability development beyond the  level expected for an undergraduate degree as outlined in C/4.3.4 below.

4.3.2 Policy outcomes
This  policy is intended to:
  articulate the       graduate capabilities which should be common to QUT undergraduate,       postgraduate and research courses
  provide a framework       for graduate capabilities at QUT
  provide faculties       with guidance on the implementation of graduate capabilities within       courses. 
Top 
4.3.3 Graduate capabilities 
Every QUT course aims to develop graduates who are able to demonstrate:
knowledge and skills pertinent to a particular discipline or professional area
encompassing:
coherent theoretical and practical knowledge in at least one discipline area at the level of
      entry to a profession
technological skills appropriate to the discipline.
critical, creative and analytical thinking, and effective problem-solving
including:
the ability to critique current paradigms and contribute to intellectual inquiry
the capacity to exhibit creative as well as analytical ways of thinking about questions in at
      least one discipline
the ability to identify, define and solve problems in at least one discipline area.
effective communication in a variety of contexts and modes
including:
effective written and oral communication with discipline specialists and non-specialists and
      in cross-cultural contexts.
the capacity for life-long learning
including: 
searching and critically evaluating information from a variety of sources using effective
        strategies and appropriate technologies.

4.3.4 Postgraduate capabilities 
It is recognised that postgraduate awards range  from graduate certificate to doctorate levels (C/3.2) and that students in  postgraduate courses are likely to have varied backgrounds in terms of prior  capability development. Consequently postgraduate courses may be designed to  place emphasis on selected graduate capabilities according to the level and  purpose of the award, or may require the development of capabilities other than  those specifically described in this policy.
Postgraduate coursework programs
In postgraduate coursework programs graduate capabilities will most likely be framed with the context
  of advanced knowledge and understanding in a specialist field of study, professional knowledge and
  skills in a specialist area of practice and/or engagement within a new field of study and the award level.
Postgraduate research programs
QUTs research training objective is to graduate high quality postgraduate research students who meet
  the needs of industry, government, the professions and the community and who are equipped to undertake
  leadership roles in those contexts. In addition to the graduate capabilities expected of all
  QUT graduates (see C/4.3.3 above), capabilities that are regarded as desirable in research graduates
  include:
advanced theoretical knowledge and analytical skills, as well as methodological, research
    design and problem-solving skills in a particular research area
advanced information processing skills and k nowledge of advanced information technologies
  and other research technologies
independence in research planning and execution, consistent with the level of the
  research degree
competence in the execution of protocols for research health and safety, ethical conduct
  and intellectual property
skills in project management, teamwork, academic writing and oral communication
awareness of the mechanisms for research results transfer to end-users, scholarly
  dissemination through publications and presentations, research policy, and research career planning.
Top 
4.3.5 Implementation and monitoring 
The University recognises that graduate  capabilities are ideally articulated and assessed within a discipline context.  Appropriate curriculum design, in the context of discipline knowledge, provides  the foundation for the development of graduate capabilities at QUT (C/4.2) as part of the  learning outcomes of QUT courses.  Requirements for implementation and monitoring, and responsibilities of faculties  are provided in the Protocols: Graduate capabilities on the Learning and Teaching Unit website.
Top 
4.3.6 Electronic portfolio 
The University promotes the use by students of electronic portfolio tools to assist in learning and
  teaching, in preparation for employment, and to emphasise the development of graduate capabilities.
  The electronic portfolio is intended to be available to students throughout their period of admission
  and on graduation a student may choose to file their portfolio data on centrally provided storage.
  Conditions for the retention of such data and provision of storage are available at 
F/1.6
and 
QUT Student ePortfolio website.Top
