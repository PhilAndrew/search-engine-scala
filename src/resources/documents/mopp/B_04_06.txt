Modification History 
A sessional academic appointment involves the academic activities of lecturing,
  tutoring, clinical nurse education, marking or other academic activity as separate
  activities. Each of these activities differs from the others in terms of duties
  and responsibilities and each is paid at appropriate rates. The definitions
  of these sessional academic activities and the salary scale are contained in
  the 
QUT Enterprise Agreement (Academic Staff)
(Schedules 5 and 2 respectively).

4.6.1 Appointment 
The relevant head of school approves the appointment of sessional academic
  staff. Sessional academic appointments are made at the start of each semester
  for the semester or part thereof only. An 
Appointment of Sessional Academic
  Staff
form is completed, signed by the relevant authority, and forwarded
  to the Pay Office, Corporate Finance Department. Once signed by the head of
  school and appointee, this form serves as confirmation to the appointee of
  total hours for which payment will be made, the units in which the appointee
  will teach, the rate of payment applicable, and the dates between which the
duties will be performed.
Top 
4.6.2 Duties and attendance 
The relevant head of school determines the duties of sessional academic staff
  provided that the nature of such duties corresponds with the duties normally
  assigned to the class of work for which payment has been approved, ie lecturing,
  tutoring, clinical nurse education, marking or other academic activity. Sessional
  academic staff are required to complete timesheets and submit them for approval
through their immediate supervisor.
Top 
4.6.3 Engagement of firm or company for sessional teaching activities 
The University can engage a firm or company for the conduct of sessional teaching
activities in the following situations
where a prominent professional firm (legal, accounting, engineering or
    similar), or a community body, provides a person to deliver a one-off guest
    lecture
where a company which operates in a specialised field is engaged to provide
    a person with special expertise to lecture for a minimum number of occasions
    in a semester, this will be undertaken on the company's behalf by a company
    officer or qualified employee. In this case, the University cannot exercise
    the usual control in course content, course development and approval etc.
Further information in relation to the appointment of companies to perform
  sessional academic duties should be obtained from the Corporate Finance Department
  before any commitment is entered into by the responsibility centre.
