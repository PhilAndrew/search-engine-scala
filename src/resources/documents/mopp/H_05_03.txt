5.3.1 Identification of works 
At various times but particularly during the University's strategic planning process, responsibility centres seek to identify a range of desirable minor works projects, only some of which will proceed after approval of the responsibility centre's annual plans and the associated budget allocation. Approved works will be in accordance with the overall direction of the Asset Management Plan and University policy. 
Responsibility centres should identify potential project costs in consultation with Facilities Management. However, requests must be forwarded to Facilities Management (Capital Works Section) at least two weeks prior to the date by which the estimate is required. Capital Works Section will prepare a broad indication of the costs involved, ie the responsibility centre will know from this whether a project is of the order of say $5 000 or $200 000. A decision can then be made by responsibility centres whether or not to include a project in their annual plans. 
Guidelines and forms required to request minor works are available on the

5.3.2 Scheduling of works 
There is typically a very high demand for minor works to be carried out during non-teaching periods. This demand puts great stress on the resources available to design and construct the works to the satisfaction of all. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, there can also be a substantial lead time required to design and tender projects.
