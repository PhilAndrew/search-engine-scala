4.3.1 General requirements for constitution of selection panels 
Selection panels are constituted for all positions except as indicated in 
B/4.1
Membership of selection panels will comply with the minimum membership as set out below, and will be
  established in accordance with the University's policy on gender balance and equity in the constitution
  of committees (see 
Council Procedure
    1 - Committees)
. Selection panels may, at their discretion, replace a member who resigns
  from the panel prior to interview, providing gender balance is maintained.
The following general guidelines also apply to selection panels:
Where persons of one gender constitute more than two thirds of the membership of a proposed selection
    panel, the Equity Director's concurrence must be obtained before the request to advertise is forwarded
    to Human Resources Department;
For positions which include shortlisted applicants who are recent migrant/s, Aborigine/s and Torres
    Strait Islanders, or person/s with disabilities, organisational units are required to reconstitute
    the selection panel to include a member with some experience or knowledge of the particular group;
Where such a member is not readily available and a pattern of representation of such groups is
    discernible in applicant pools, the head of the organisational unit should organise appropriate training
    and staff development action for a member of staff to fill this role on future selection panels;
For academic positions and positions classified above HEW Level 6, the selection panel will include
    at least one person from outside the organisational unit of the position;
The size of the selection panel will be as small as practicable (no less than two) and, except
    where the minimum provisions below state a greater number, no more than six persons.
Only persons who have completed the University's staff development programs on recruitment and selection
  processes and equity principles will chair selection panels unless agreed by the Human Resources Director.
  The Chair of the selection panel is responsible for ensuring that the panel complies with the University's
  recruitment and selection policies and procedures, and that due process is followed.
Where a person related to a selection panel member either by kinship or close personal circumstances
  is an applicant for a position being considered by the panel, the panel member must declare this to
  the Chair of the selection panel or, in the case of the Chair, to the officer delegated to approve
  the appointment (referred to elsewhere in this policy as the 
authorising officer
  see 
Schedule
  of Authorities and Delegations
. Appropriate action will depend on the circumstances and
  advice in these situations can be obtained from the Human Resources Department.
The Human Resources Director and the Equity Director will monitor panel membership and report
  to the Vice-Chancellor as appropriate.
