Modification History
7.6.1 Workers' compensation coverage for QUT staff 
As required under the Workers'  Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003, QUT has an insurance policy  to provide compensation for staff members injured in the course of their  employment. Health and Safety Advisory Services in the Human Resources  Department coordinates workers' compensation claims initiated within the legal  timeframes after the issue of a doctor's medical certificate.
  Hard copies of the Workers'  Compensation and Rehabilitation Act and associated  regulations are held for reference by Health and Safety Advisory Services  and the QUT Library.
  Further information regarding accident and safety reporting at QUT and  application procedures and entitlements under WorkCover is available from the Human Resources website.

7.6.2 Worker's compensation entitlements when working outside Queensland  
Workers' compensation entitlements  when working outside Queensland for periods less than six months
  A QUT staff member, who works outside of Queensland on a temporary basis,  either interstate or overseas, for a period of less than six months, will be  covered for the duration of the employment by  the QUT workers' compensation insurance policy subject to the following
  where the staff       member continues to be paid by QUT directly (however, in the case of a       Professional Development Program which involves full-time study, coverage       will only be provided where the study is a documented condition of the       staff member's employment with QUT)
  where the staff       member is on unpaid leave whether for special reasons or study leave,       coverage will not be provided unless the program is a condition of       their employment. 
Where the staff member receives funds or remuneration from external sources  they would not be indemnified under the QUT workers' compensation insurance  policy. If, however, the funds or remuneration are paid directly to QUT for  their work or services they would be considered under the employment of QUT and  covered under the QUT workers' compensation insurance policy.
Workers' compensation entitlements  when working outside Queensland for periods greater than six months
  If a QUT staff member's usual location of employment is Queensland, but that  staff member works outside of Queensland, either interstate or overseas, for a  period of greater than 6 months, the staff member will not be covered by the QUT workers' compensation insurance policy. Instead,  the staff member will need to be covered under a different policy. Supervisors  of such staff members should contact their human resources advisors for advice.
  &nbsp;
  Workers' compensation entitlements where  usual location of employment is interstate or overseas (any period of time)
If a QUT staff member's usual location of employment is interstate or  overseas for any period of time, the staff member will not be covered by the QUT workers' compensation insurance policy.  Instead, the staff member will need to be covered under a different policy. Supervisors  of such staff members should contact their human resources advisors for advice.

7.6.3 Volunteers  and other honorary roles
