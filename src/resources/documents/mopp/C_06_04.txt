  Modification  History 
6.4.1 Policy  
QUT seeks to provide excellent learning  environments as part of its stated objectives. The University recognises that the recording of lectures, either audio  or video, or the streaming of lectures can assist students by providing them  with the ability to review and revise lecture material. It also facilitates the  &ldquo;time shifting or place shifting&rdquo; of lectures, for example in the case of  students studying by distance mode.

6.4.2 Recording by faculties  
The University does not mandate a  comprehensive system of recording lectures. However, faculties may determine a  policy for recording some or all lectures for the purposes outlined above.  Students should be advised of the availability and conditions of use of such  recorded lecture material. 
It is expected that faculties would liaise with the relevant service areas of the Division of Technology, Information and Learning Support for  assistance in regard to the recording process.

6.4.3 Recording by students 
Where the recording of lectures is  not provided by the faculty, students may request permission to record a lecture if the recording is to be used solely for the purpose of studying or  revising the lecture material. This request should be made to the lecturer before commencing a recording and should  describe the proposed action and the medium in which the recording is proposed.
Any reasonable request from a  student should not be refused.  &ldquo;Reasonable request&rdquo; means a request in which the student undertakes to  use the recording solely for the purpose of studying and revising lecture material,  and where there is no significant disruption to the class or teaching space. Further, the student must  undertake 
  not to provide the recorded material to any other  persons, unless with the prior consent of the lecturer, and
  to destroy the recorded material at the completion of  study for that unit.
For students  with a disability, alternative teaching practices may already be provided under  the University's disability services policy (see A/8.6).
Copyright
As the student is recording the  material for the review of content provided in the course, the recorded  material is regarded as teaching material and, under the University's  intellectual property policy (see D/3.1), copyright of QUT teaching material resides with the University.  There is therefore no copyright reason for refusing a request by a  student to record a lecture.
