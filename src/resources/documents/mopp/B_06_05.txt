Modification History 
6.5.1 Application 
This policy applies to academic and professional staff.
Provisions for leave without pay for senior staff are detailed in the 
QUT Employee Collective Agreement (Senior Staff) 2009-2012
Top 
6.5.2 Entitlement 
Leave without pay would only normally be granted after all recreation leave credits have been exhausted.
A staff member requiring leave without pay will provide as much notice as possible of the leave.
Top 
6.5.3 Conditions 
If a  continuous period of leave without pay exceeds 10 working days, that period of  leave exceeding 10 days
  is not recognised as service for the purpose of  calculating long service leave, recreation leave and sick leave
  will affect the staff member&rsquo;s average service  fraction for the purpose of calculating paid maternity leave entitlements  (refer to B/6.6.3).
For leave in excess of one month, the staff member's increment date is  changed by the total period of leave. If leave without pay is taken during a  period of probation, the probation will be suspended for the period of the  leave without pay.
Leave may not be granted in broken periods separated by public holidays or by periods of long service
  or recreation leave. Public holidays which fall in the period of leave without pay form part of the
  leave.
Staff whose positions may be affected by restructuring whilst on leave without pay will be notified
  of any proposed changes and will be provided an opportunity to participate in any consultation.
Staff seeking leave without pay may wish to discuss the requirements of the relevant superannuation
  funds during the period of leave with the University's Superannuation Officer, Human Resources Department.
