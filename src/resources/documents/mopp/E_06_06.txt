Modification History 
6.6.1 Policy 
The University is committed to a policy of openness with respect to the  release of assessment results. This  policy of openness supports the purposes of assessment, including the objective  of providing feedback as an aid to future learning (C/5.1.1
), and meets QUT's obligations under right to information and privacy legislation.

6.6.2 Access to marks 
For units where percentage  marks are calculated, such marks will be placed on the confidential individual  student records located in the QUT Virtual web pages ( 
https://qutvirtual.qut.edu.au/
).  Provision of information to students about component marks for individual  assessment items in a unit is encouraged.
Top 
6.6.3 Access to examination scripts 
A student may request  access to their own examination scripts, written answers to examination  questions or other forms of written assessment. The request must be made within three months of the release of final  results in the unit, as this is the minimum period for which examination  scripts or other written materials must be retained (for further information,  refer to 
http://www.governance.qut.edu.au/rms/accessing_records/
).  Where a student intends to seek review of the  grade, access to the written materials should be sought and provided within the  timeframe specified for review of grades (E/9.1
Unit coordinators must  make appropriate arrangements for students to obtain access to examination  scripts and other written materials.  Access  is generally in the form of perusal of the examination script under  supervision, which may incorporate individual feedback on performance where  possible.
If a student requests  a photocopy of their examination script, a fee is levied under 
Schedule 2
of  the Student Rules.
However, where  examination question papers or other forms of assessment will be re-used in  successive examinations, unit coordinators must arrange for students to receive  advice on their performance with reference to their own examination scripts in  a way which does not prejudice the examination mode.  In this case, the student is not entitled to  obtain a photocopy of the examination script.
Top 
6.6.4 Return of assignments to students 
Assignments are  generally returned to students following completion of marking.  This should be done in a manner which does  not breach other students' privacy and which protects students' work from  tampering or unauthorised collection.
