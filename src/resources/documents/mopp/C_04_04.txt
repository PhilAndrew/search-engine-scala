4.4.1 Policy principles 
Work integrated learning is an integral component of curriculum design  across the disciplines at QUT and supports the University&rsquo;s overall vision  through the following principles: 
  all undergraduate courses are expected to provide the opportunity for students to undertake various forms of work integrated learning during their course including, but not limited to, experience in professional workplaces 
  work integrated learning opportunities are expected to build mutually beneficial and long term outcomes for students, the University, industry, professional partners and the community. 
This policy
  covers all work integrated learning which forms a formal, credit bearing component of a course  in which a student is enrolled, and which has the prior approval of QUT
  does not cover student work experience in industry where learning experiences are not  integrated within the course and not relevant to the learning outcomes of the  overall course. 
Top 
4.4.2 Policy outcomes 
The policy is designed to
  provide the framework in which QUT offers work integrated learning opportunities for students
  describe the roles and responsibilities relating to the offering of work integrated learning.
Top 
4.4.3 Definitions 
&ldquo;Work integrated learning&ldquo; is an umbrella term used  for a range of approaches and strategies that integrate theory with the  practice of work within a purposefully designed curriculum, including planned,  assessed (credit bearing) activities that:
  provide opportunities for students to apply theoretical knowledge and creative problem solving
  develop and consolidate skills
  reflect on practice, and 
  develop an understanding of the practice of relevant professions or related sectors. 
Work integrated learning combines professional work experiences  with classroom studies in many forms, including: 
  professional work placements (including virtual placements) 
  internships, practicum, field/clinical placements 
  service learning 
  community service 
  industry projects, site visits 
  guest lectures 
  capstone activities (eg career decision making and preparation for transition to employment)
  cooperative education 
  simulations (eg mock pharmacy, moot court, in-house productions, simulated stock exchange, design proposals). 
Top 
4.4.4 Design of work integrated  learning units 
Work integrated learning units are designed so that  learning experiences are integrated within the course and are relevant to the learning outcomes of the overall course. All units have a clearly defined set  of learning outcomes which take into account QUT graduate capabilities (C/4.3) and comply with University policy on units and unit outlines (C/4.5) and evaluation of courses, units, teaching and student experience (C/4.7). Students should be encouraged to make use of the electronic portfolio  (F/1.6 ) for reflecting,  recording and presenting the skills and capabilities gained during work integrated learning.
Work integrated learning should form a structured learning activity that enables students to:
  apply theoretical knowledge and creative problem solving to practical, workplace related issues / needs
  further develop skills and knowledge related to the industry or profession and applicable to other work places 
  reflect on work practices and practical experience 
  broaden context related skills, knowledge and values
  develop social and cultural sensitivities.
Work integrated learning will be incorporated  throughout the course, but a particular emphasis is likely to be in the latter  stages of the course to facilitate the transition from student to professional.  Work integrated learning opportunities can form a suite of activities  throughout the course, commencing with opportunities based on first year  experience principles, and developing through to final year internships as  'capstone' experiences where the student has an opportunity to work independently  (C/4.2). All activities will be conducted in accordance with workplace health  and safety requirements.
Assessment of work integrated learning units must  comply with the University&rsquo;s policy on Assessment (C/5.1) and should also address the points listed above. 
Top 
4.4.5 QUT classification of  work integrated learning work placement units 
Work integrated learning work placements must form  part of a formal component of a course (ie part or all of a formal unit with  credit points and assessment attached). Work placement units should be designed  such that student learning and performance is either directed by QUT or supported by QUT in accordance with the Higher  Education Support Act 2003 (Cwth) (Administration Guidelines under section  238-10) as defined below.
a)	Student learning  and performance is directed if all of the following are performed by QUT or persons engaged by QUT:
  definition and management of the implementation of educational content and objectives of the unit
  definition and management of the standard of learning and performance to be achieved by the student during the placement
  definition and management of assessment of student learning and performance during the  placement 
  ongoing and regular  input and contact with students, and
  oversight and  direction of work occurring during its performance, not just the progress of a student&rsquo;s work.
b)	Student learning  and performance is supported if all  of the following are performed by QUT or persons engaged by QUT:
  interaction between  the supervisor and the student, which may include site visits
  organisation and/or  approval of student placements
  ongoing monitoring  of student work and progress, and
  assessment of  student learning and performance during the placement.
