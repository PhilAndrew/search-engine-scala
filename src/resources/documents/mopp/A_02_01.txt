2.1.1 Vision and goals 
QUT is a leading university of technology which aims to strengthen its distinctive
  national and international reputation by combining academic strength and practical
  engagement with the world of the professions, industry, government, and the
broader community.
In line with this aim, QUT's overall vision for the future is:
to provide outstanding learning environments and programs that lead
        to excellent outcomes for graduates, enabling them to work in and guide
          a world characterised by increasing change;
to undertake high-impact research and development in selected areas,
          at the highest international standards, reinforcing the University's
        applied emphasis and securing significant commercial and practical outcomes;
          and
to strengthen and extend the University's strategic partnerships with
          professional and broader communities to reflect both its academic ambitions
          and its civic responsibility.
Five key goals will guide QUT's progress towards attaining
      this vision:
to build research capacity in selected areas;
to strengthen the University's reputation for quality teaching and learning
    and provide among the best learning environments in Australia ;
to strengthen the University's “real-world” positioning in teaching and
    research through better partnerships across internal and external boundaries;
to integrate information and communications technology into teaching, research,
    business support functions and infrastructure; and
to develop environments
      that foster and reward high-quality scholarship and that build a sense
    of community.
