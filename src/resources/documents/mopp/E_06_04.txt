  Services website.
6.4.1 Policy principles 
Supplementary assessment is provided to support course  progression, and is  designed to create opportunities for students to  complete requirements for their qualification. Supplementary assessment is not  a reassessment of the student's overall grade or the mark for an individual  assessment item (E/9.1). It is a new item of  assessment designed to provide further opportunity to demonstrate that the  student has achieved the required learning outcomes of the unit.

6.4.2 Granting of supplementary  assessment 
Students may be granted supplementary assessment in a limited  number of cases where a grade of 3 has been achieved. This limit is such that  the maximum number overall in a course is:
  four in coursework programs of three or more years full-time  duration or equivalent, or 
  two in coursework programs of less than three years full-time  duration or equivalent. 
Supplementary assessment will not be granted on designated units  (see E/6.7.3 for  definition of designated units) or on units undertaken in non-award courses (C/3.3).
Top 
6.4.3 Application for  supplementary assessment 
Students are responsible for making applications for supplementary  assessment. Students will be provided  with timely, accurate information and advice to assist them in their decision  making about applications for supplementary assessment. Applications should be submitted immediately  (normally within five working days) following release of the final result for a  unit. More information regarding these deadlines is available on the Student Services website.
Top
6.4.4 Grades  following completion of supplementary assessment
Students who successfully complete supplementary assessment  requirements will be awarded the grade of 4. Where supplementary assessment is  not successfully completed, the original grade of 3 will be reinstated.Top
6.4.5 Transfer between courses
Where students transfer between QUT courses, supplementary  assessments that have already been granted for units being credited towards the  second course will count towards the maximum number of supplementary  assessments allowed for the second course.
