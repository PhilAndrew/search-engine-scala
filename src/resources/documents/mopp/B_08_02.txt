Modification History 
The 
Crime and Misconduct Act 2001 
(Qld) places a statutory obligation on the University to
  refer all cases of suspected official misconduct to the Crime and Misconduct Commission. 
Official misconduct is conduct relating to the performance of a staff member's duties that is:
dishonest or lacks impartiality
involves a breach of trust, or
is a misuse of officially obtained information.
To amount to official misconduct, the conduct must also be a criminal offence or serious enough to
  justify dismissal.
Official misconduct also includes conduct by anyone who seeks to corrupt a public officer.
Any reasonable suspicion that a University employee is involved in official misconduct should be reported
  immediately to the Registrar.
