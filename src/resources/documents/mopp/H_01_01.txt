Modification History 
QUT, as a statutory authority constituted in terms of the 
Queensland
University
of
Technology
    Act
1998
(the QUT Act) and under Queensland legislation, must
comply with relevant building and financial legislation, principally
the QUT Act, in particular Schedule 1 to the Act concerning Control of
    Traffic and Conduct on University Land
the 
Building Act 1975
(Qld) (including the 
Standard Building
      Regulation
1993 and the 
Building Code of Australia 2005
      The University performs the duties of a local authority, as defined in
      the Building Act
for building works carried out for University
      purposes.
the 
Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995
(Qld), the 
Workplace Health and Safety Regulation 2008, the 
Codes of Practice
and the 
Industry Codes of Practice
(see 
http://www.deir.qld.gov.au/workplace/index.htm). These
      also refer to relevant Australian Standards and national standards and guidelines (see
      section 
A/9.1
the
Electrical Safety Act  2002  and subordinate legislation
the 
Financial Accountability Act 2009
(Qld) and the
    associated 
Financial and Performance Management Standard 2009
. Of particular significance
    is the adoption by the University of the provisions of the State Procurement
    Policy, issued in accordance with the Financial Management Standard, as a
    guide to its purchasing decisions. These provisions impact on the procurement
    of works and services and require the University to ensure that accountable
    and competitive practices are employed with a view to obtaining value for
    money in the supply of all goods and services (see Chapter 
G
, and
    the 
Financial
    Management Practice and Procedures Manual
). The Financial Management
  Standard also requires strategic planning for physical assets.
the 
  Integrated Planning Act 1997 (Qld) - the University has achieved
  the designation of the majority of its land as community infrastructure under
  the Integrated Planning Act. This designation expires on 19 April 2006 . The
  exact lots of land which have been designated vary from time to time and are
  available from Facilities Management. Developments on designated land do not
  require Brisbane City Council approval, providing they are in accordance with
  the approved QUT Master Plan which has been developed in consultation with the
  Brisbane City Council and other stakeholders.
