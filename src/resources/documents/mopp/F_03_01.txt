3.1.1 Strategy 
Marketing strategies at all levels should respond explicitly to the University's strategic goals and
  key performance indicators. Marketing strategies should be informed by relevant market and industry
  research. All proposals to commission market research from external suppliers must be approved by the
Marketing and Communication Director.
The Vice-Chancellor approves institutional marketing strategies in consultation with Vice-Chancellor's Advisory Committee.

3.1.2 Planning 
Institutional  strategies are given effect through rolling three-year corporate plans for domestic  and international marketing. The Marketing and Communication Department works with each faculty and institute  to prepare an annual marketing communication plan  that is aligned with the corporate plans but which is framed in light of local  contextual factors. The faculty or institute plan should include all activities  proposed for the following calendar year in all marketing communication media.  Faculty and institute plans are subject to approval by the relevant executive dean or institute director.
