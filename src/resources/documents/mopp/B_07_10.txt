Modification History
7.10.1 Policy 
QUT Council  recognises that in exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to pay salary  loadings to University staff as follows: 
  a management loading in order to       attract and retain high performing managers or to recognise the       performance of significant management responsibility; or 
  a market loading in order to attract       an appropriate field of candidates and secure or retain the services of       high performing staff. 
Approval  authorities for the payment of management and market loadings are outlined in MOPP Appendix 3 Schedule of Authorities and Delegations. 
Top7.10.2 Management loadings 
A  management loading may be paid to a senior staff position (SSG1 - SSG6) and, in  exceptional circumstances, to an academic position with significant management  responsibility, at the discretion of the authorising officer.
Where a  management loading in excess of 20% is considered appropriate to be paid to a  senior staff position (SSG1-SSG 3) or to an academic position, the relevant  executive dean or head of division must submit a recommendation outlining the  reasons why to the authorising officer.
Management  loadings are payable for up to five years and are renewable. 
Top7.10.3 Market loadings &ndash; academic  and professional staff 
A  market loading may be attached to certain appointments where at least one of  the following criteria for paying a market loading has been met: 
  there is       sustained difficulty in recruiting and/or retaining high performing staff       in an area; 
  there is       evidence that loss of a particular staff member from a position deemed       critical to the continued efficient development of the University's       infrastructure would have a significant detrimental impact on the       University; or
  for professional       staff, there is evidence of disparity between University salary levels and       the external private sector and/or comparable universities.
Market  loadings are payable for up to three years, may be reviewed and adjusted  annually, and are renewable.
Market  loadings are not payable to senior managers. 
Top7.10.4 Reporting 
The  Human Resource Director monitors approval of all salary loadings and reports to  the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and the Vice-Chancellor as appropriate  and as required.
