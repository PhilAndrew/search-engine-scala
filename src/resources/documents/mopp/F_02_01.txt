2.1.1 QUT corporate identity 
The way in which QUT visually presents itself to the public influences the image that people have
of the University.
The aims of the corporate identity program are:
to create a single, consistent and clear visual identity for QUT
to project the University as a professional, reliable and contemporary organisation
to standardise the University's visual presentation in a number of applications, thereby increasing
    efficiency.
QUT's commitment to the appropriate use of information technology facilities, including the development
  and maintenance of University Web pages, forms part of this corporate identity program (see QUT Web
  Corporate Identity Manual (
http://www.webmanual.qut.edu.au/

2.1.2 Approval of identity elements 
The Vice-Chancellor approves the corporate identity of the University that is applied to stationery,
  signage, uniforms, certificates and parchments, and other corporate uses. The corporate identity includes
  the QUT logo and “real world” slogan (both Registered Trade Marks), corporate colours, typefaces and
  other elements of visual identity. The rules governing corporate identity are collected in the 
Corporate
  Identity Manual
which is reviewed and updated periodically by the Marketing and Communication
Department .

2.1.3 Implementation of identity standards 
Implementation of the University's corporate identity is managed by the Marketing and Communication
  Department. All applications of the QUT name, logo or slogan, whether produced by QUT or third parties,
must be checked for corporate identity compliance and approved by the Marketing and Communication Director.
