Modification History 
The University is a Statutory Authority pursuant to the 
Financial Accountability Act 2009
and is subject to the same legislative and policy requirements as applies to other government
    and semi-governmental agencies. This includes the Act itself and subordinate guidelines, as well
    as other pronouncements such as the State Procurement Policy. This framework is generally not prescriptive
    on what can or cannot be charged to the University's accounts except to state that all expenditure
    must be for official purposes and must not, except in special cases (such as 
losses and special
payments 
as defined) be for private purposes.
The University derives a major part of its funds from the Government, but is increasingly reliant
  upon its commercial endeavours to support its operational and capital requirements. The University
  is therefore required to administer its expenditure in a manner which adheres to standards of public
  sector accountability, but which also supports the flexibility required of an institution operating
  within a more commercial framework.

5.1.1 Official expenditure 
Expenditure is to be incurred for official purposes only and, if required, officers must be able to
identify the relationship or nexus between the expenses and the official business of the University.
Under no circumstances shall University expenditure be incurred for personal or private purposes (see 
G/5.2
Prior to committing to the expenditure of money, an appropriately delegated officer must ensure that
  the expense:
is an appropriate and reasonable use of University funds

      policy -

Expenditure must be able to be supported on the basis of reasonableness and be publicly defensible.
  Expenditure is to be properly declared and documented.
