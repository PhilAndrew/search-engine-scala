3.3.1 Creation of positions 
The Vice-Chancellor approves the creation of privately funded academic positions at Level E (professor),
  and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) approves positions at Levels C - D (senior lecturer
  and associate professor). These positions are funded by industry, commerce or statutory authorities,
  and may be named after sponsoring organisations at the discretion of the Vice-Chancellor or, where
appropriate, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic). 
Duties and responsibilities of staff in privately funded positions must be consistent with the development
  and reputation of QUT and the relevant school and faculty. The position must be in an area in which
  QUT either has already established or intends to establish a reputation. 
The creation of privately funded academic positions is negotiated through the Alumni and Development Office.
  There are specific requirements for committing and administering funds for this purpose (see 
G/2.1
Sponsored appointments are normally advertised and filled in accordance with QUT policy on recruitment
  and selection. However, when funding for a sponsored position is dependent upon the appointment of
  a nominated person, the matter shall be referred to the Vice-Chancellor or where appropriate the Deputy
  Vice-Chancellor (Academic) for approval to proceed. Upon such approval, the appropriate selection panel
  shall be constituted to determine whether the nominee meets the selection criteria for appointment
  and to make a recommendation on appointment to the Vice-Chancellor or where appropriate the Deputy
  Vice-Chancellor (Academic).
