5.2.1 Overview 
Items that fall under the category of official expenditure are in most cases obvious. They are those
  expenses that clearly relate to the carriage of official duties and responsibilities. This would include
  payments relating to entitlements and conditions of employment such as official travel expenses payable
to a staff member.
However the issue of what 
should not 
be charged to the accounts of the University is
  subject to judgment in terms of the relationship, either direct or implied, of that expenditure to
  the carriage of official duties and responsibilities. Examples of expenditure in this grey area, which
  requires particular discretion by financial delegates prior to approval, include expenditure on entertainment,
  purchases such as flowers for special occasions, and any expenditure that on face value could be argued
  to be private in nature (such as outlays for non-official goods and services).
All financial delegates need to err towards caution in considering whether these type of expenditures
  should be approved, and if any doubt exists, the circumstances underpinning the authorisation should
  be fully documented. All authorisations of expenditure need to be 
publicly defensible 
  For contentious items the appropriate financial delegate must be a senior officer in the University
  (executive dean of faculty or head of division, or a higher position if necessary) and if doubt exists
  the Director, Corporate Finance should be consulted.
Financial delegates authorising expenditure must ensure that account codes properly portray the nature
  of the expenditure and the program against which the expenditure has been charged.
Under no circumstances, should a financial delegate approve reimbursement claims for themselves. All
  reimbursements must be approved by the University officer's immediate superior, or a higher position
  if necessary and in accordance with relevant University policies and procedures.

5.2.2 Non-official or private expenses 
Non-official or private expenses should not be provided unless a reasonable nexus can be established
  between the expenditure and the carriage of official duties and responsibilities. Examples of expenses
that are generally regarded as non-official include:
non-official entertainment and travel costs (eg excessive or lavish entertainment
    expenditure and, whilst travelling, personal video hire fees, mini-bar alcohol consumption, personal
    grooming, recreation activities etc)
tips or gratuities (except when the University officer is travelling on official business
      in a country in which it is customary)
dinners/functions at a University officer's private residence (unless specifically
    authorised by the Vice-Chancellor before the event)
casual drinks (off campus)
parking for non-business related trips
valet parking (unless there are no other alternatives)
parking and traffic fines
gifts of an essentially private nature (eg birthday or wedding gifts for staff members).
It is acknowledged that there will be circumstances in which a proportion of expenditure is non-official
  or private (eg hotel accounts containing private phone call charges, mobile phone accounts containing
  private call charges). The private component of these charges should be settled privately and not charged
  to the University by credit card or account.
Nature of expenses unclear
In circumstances where the nature of expenses is unclear, the University officer should meet the expense
  in the first instance and subsequently submit a claim with appropriate rationale to Corporate Finance
  for determination.
