Modification History 
This policy should be read in conjunction with the 
QUT 
  Student Rules
and information provided on the 
Student 
  Services website
Top 
7.1.1 Imposition of student contributions, fees and charges 
QUT administers tuition fees and student contributions to higher education in accordance with the 
Higher Education Support Act 2003
(Cwth) (HES Act). Changes may be made to any provisions of this Act at any time. The administrative provisions flowing from this Act are expressed for students on the 
Going to Uni
website and for university administrators in the 
administrative information for providers
A student is not validly enrolled unless all specified student contribution amounts, tuition fees and incidental fees have been paid (Student Rule 8).
Top 
7.1.2 Fee and contribution types and approval authority  
Schedule 2
of the Student Rules identifies the student contribution amounts, tuition fees and incidental fees that may be set by QUT, and the approval authority. The student contribution amounts, tuition fees and incidental fees are regularly reviewed and are subject to change.
QUT may provide exemption scholarships either for Commonwealth contribution amounts or tuition fees
  for a student's course of study. The Research Training Scheme (RTS) provides Commonwealth-funded higher
  degree by research (HDR) students with an 'entitlement' to a student contribution amount exemption
  for the duration of an accredited HDR course, up to a maximum period of four years' full-time equivalent
  study for a Doctorate by research and two years' full-time equivalent study for a Masters by research.
Further information on the RTS is available on the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research website.
QUT charges incidental fees for specific student administration activities (see 
Schedule 2
- Table H, and the 
Student Services website
), and cancellation fees (see 
Schedule 2
- Table I (domestic students) and Table J (international students)).
Changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) have resulted in amended student contribution rates and citizenship eligibility conditions. QUT will enrol students as eligible students for pre-2008, pre-2009  or pre-2010 provisions
in accordance with Commonwealth transitional arrangements. Consideration of the enrolment practices of higher education providers other than QUT may be relevant to the decision on eligibility of transfer students for these provisions.
Top 
7.1.3 Due dates for forms and payment of fees 
The Registrar determines
census dates
dates for payment of tuition fees and upfront student contribution amounts, normally shown on student 
statements of account
dates for submission of forms related to tuition fees and charges, in particular requests for Commonwealth assistance under 
HECS-HELP
or 
FEE-HELP
. The Registrar may set due dates earlier than the census dates for administrative purposes.
Top 
7.1.4 Partial up-front payment of student contribution amounts 
In accordance with legislation, QUT will accept partial up-front payment of a student contribution amount provided it is sufficient to attract a discount.
Top 
7.1.5 Re-credit of student learning entitlement, debt remission and payment refunds 
The Registrar determines administrative provisions for students who 
withdraw from units
or 
interrupt their studies
and the procedures and timelines for students seeking 
re-credit of learning entitlement
Top 
7.1.6 Consequences of non-payment of student contributions, tuition fees and charges 
One of the 
consequences
of non-payment of student contribution amounts, tuition fees and charges (Student Rule 27) is for the Registrar to reject a student's enrolment. Depending on the circumstances and the nature of the student's enrolment, the rejection may be immediate, or applied in a staged manner through the imposition of sanctions or encumbrances on student access to services. International students cannot remain in Australia on their student visa if their enrolment is rejected.
Top7.1.7 Exemption from payment of fees 
A student may be granted exemption from payment of fees in any of  the following circumstances
  humanitarian initiative
  addressing the effect of natural disaster, terrorism or pandemic
  loss of fees sponsor under exceptional circumstance
  impeded progress due to personal, medical or other special circumstances beyond the student&rsquo;s  control
  unanticipated change in personal circumstances resulting in lack of sufficient income and/ or capital or otherwise indebtedness to an extent that a  continuing student has no reasonable means available to pay fees.
Exemption from payment of tuition fees or student contribution  amounts is subject to HESA provisions and associated administrative guidelines.  The majority of exemption arrangements will be effected as sponsorships charged  against nominated University cost centres.
Exemption from payment of incidental fees or charges will be effected  by the waiver of the fee or charge, or the reversal of the fee or charge if it  has already been applied to the student.Top
