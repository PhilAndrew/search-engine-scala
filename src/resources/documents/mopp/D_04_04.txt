4.4.1 Description 
A research group, node, laboratory, program or domain is the fourth tier of research activity recognised
  within QUT's research structure. These are smaller research groupings, established by a faculty or
  institute and recognised by the University. The terms describe an area of focused research activity
  that has a group of researchers and resources underpinning the research focus. Research groups, nodes,
  laboratories, programs or domains , because of the focused nature of their research activity, provide
  an avenue for the development of the research experience of staff, including early-career researchers,
  and for discipline-based, problem-focused and/or thematic research.
A 
research group
is smaller than a centre and undertakes focused research activity within
  a faculty, or across faculties.
A 
research node
is a focused research activity within a faculty, is smaller than a centre,
  has specific connections to other research nodes, or forms the stem of a larger research activity.
A 
research laboratory
is a facility, with ongoing support and staff, for focused research
  activity.
A 
research program
may be narrowly focussed in a specific discipline or interdisciplinary
  in nature and may be within or across faculties.
A 
research domain
is usually a multi-disciplinary research program within an institute.
Top 
4.4.2 Awarding of status 
Research group / node / laboratory / program / domain status is recognised by a faculty, or by agreement
  between faculties or by an institute or combination of faculty/ies and institutes . The Office of Research
  maintains a register of these.
Research group / node / laboratory / program / domain status is  recognised by a faculty, or by agreement between faculties or by an institute  or combination of faculty/ies and institutes. The Office of Research maintains  a register of these. 
Faculties / institutes  normally establish research groups / nodes / laboratories / programs / domains  through the faculty academic board within the strategic planning cycle. A  formal process is used. It is based on the Tier 3 research centre status  application proforma and guidelines (see
D/4.3.3 and
  also application proforma for Tier 3 research groups on 
  Office
  of Research web page).
Top 
4.4.3 Resources 
The sponsors are responsible for ensuring that there is active management and an appropriate level
  of resources so that high quality research and the development of staff can take place. Staff involvement
  in leadership roles within research groups / nodes / laboratories / programs / domains is managed through
  Performance Planning and Review (PPR) processes (see 
B/9.2
and 
B/9.3
  Normally, the leader of such a group will be referred to as a coordinator / leader .
Top 
4.4.4 Reporting 
Research groups / nodes / laboratories / programs / domains report to the executive dean of faculty
  / institute director / head of school or nominee, on day-to-day management and academic activities,
  in accordance with the reporting processes established by the faculty / institute . The faculty / institute
  is required to submit an annual report on its research activity to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research
  and Commercialisation) through the Office of Research, including a recommendation for continuation
  or termination of status of all its research groups / nodes / laboratories / programs / domains.
Top 
4.4.5 Changes to name, mission, objectives or structure 
Changes to title, mission, objectives, and structure normally occur within the context of the annual
  reporting cycle.
Applications are considered by the executive dean of faculty / institute director , who approves the
  change and forwards the endorsement via the relevant faculty / institute governance structure to University
  Research and Innovation Committee for noting.
Top 
4.4.6 Termination of status 
The decision to wind up a group / node / laboratory / program / domain is made by the relevant faculty
  / institute governance structure/s, on the recommendation of the executive dean of faculty / institute
  director, at a time judged appropriate. A research group / node / laboratory / program / domain may
  be wound up when the purpose for which it was established has been fulfilled or is no longer a strategic
  priority for the faculty / institute, when it has ceased to be active, or when it is no longer performing
  at a level judged appropriate by the faculty / institute. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and
  Commercialisation) must be advised by the faculty / institute of its action in winding up a research
  group / node / laboratory / program / domain via the relevant faculty / institute governance structure/s.Top
