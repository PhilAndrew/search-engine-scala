5.1.1 Postgraduate research programs 
QUT offers postgraduate research programs at Masters and Doctoral levels, including Professional Doctorates
  in some faculties. This policy applies to the management of postgraduate research programs. QUT is
  committed to the development and provision of postgraduate research programs that support and stimulate
  rigorous and significant research training activities and internationally benchmarked outcomes. Research
  training, supervision and reporting requirements of the University are intended to encourage a vigorous
  and dynamic interdisciplinary research culture. QUT recognises that research and research training
  are intimately connected and that to ensure successful outcomes these activities need to take place
in an environment where the appropriate expertise and resources exist.
Broad definition of postgraduate research programs in terms of entry standards, duration, and depth
  and breadth of study are provided in 
C/3.2
  Postgraduate research programs are developed around the DEEWR definition of 'Research Higher Degree '
  where coursework components should not exceed one third of the program, as detailed in the 
Research
Training Scheme Guidelines
Also provided in C/3.2 are definitions of related programs such as undergraduate honours and postgraduate
    coursework programs, which contain elements of research training and may provide pathways to postgraduate
research programs.
University Research and  Innovation Committee, in addition to its role in the development of all policy  on research matters, is responsible for all policy regarding research based  postgraduate studies. In the case of research master and professional doctorate  programs, faculty academic boards administer the individual courses but submit  rules and an annual report to Research Degrees Committee (see C/4.6 for details of  course performance reports). In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)  program, Research Degrees Committee is directly responsible for policy  implementation and for the day-to-day administration of the program.
Top 
5.1.2 Location of research higher degree programs 
Doctoral degree candidates are normally only accepted for programs within approved research structures
  in order to ensure that adequate resources, particularly library collections, are available to underpin
  a doctoral program and that adequate supervision can be provided. The enrolling entity for a postgraduate
  research program is a faculty; however the research may be carried out in an institute or in external
industry or research organisations.
Top 
5.1.3 Coordination of research training 
All research training programs are coordinated at faculty level, usually by the Assistant or Associate
  Dean (Research) or nominee. While institutes do not enrol research students they do coordinate aspects
  of the administration of research training programs in collaboration with faculties. Institutes initiate
  and manage institute-specific support and training activities for research students who are members
  of institutes. Faculty academic boards report on the full suite of their research training programs
  within the annual Faculty Academic Program Report (see 
C/4.6.4
  which includes, if appropriate, a report on participating institute programs and scholarships.
The coordination of research training programs includes overview and administration of the academic
  advising, admission, induction and candidature of research students and contribution to the improvement
  of the research training environment through:
preparation of a research degrees handbook for the faculty
contribution to research higher degree  (RHD) recruitment activities, including information sessions
    for honours students
coordination of faculty/school/centre based orientation and induction process for new RHD students
coordination of a series of seminars involving research students and staff
participation in panels dealing with the major milestones for RHD students (eg Stage Two proposals,
    confirmations, final seminars) and ensuring timely feedback by supervisors to students at these points
coordination of the examination process and timely execution of corrections as required by examiners
maintaining an overview of commencing load and completion targets and advising the head of school/centre
    director accordingly
coordination of supervisor accreditation and a supervision training program, including appropriate
    mentoring arrangements for new supervisors
supporting student networking and academic initiatives and the development of an active student
    association
contribution to the faculty research committee, or institute committee if appropriate, in connection
    with research training policy and procedures.
if appropriate, coordination and liaison with institute staff to ensure the research training needs
    of students who are members of the institute are met.
While day-to-day administration of research training programs may occur in faculty research centres
  and groups, or in schools which enrol research students directly into research programs that are not
  recognised as centres, the overall responsibility for coordination lies at faculty level.
A faculty level research coordinator, designated according to the location of the nominated principal
  supervisor, will coordinate supervision of students who are enrolled across more than one faculty.
  Similarly where there is supervision across schools, the faculty nominates a designated coordinator
  for each student.
Top 
5.1.4 Postgraduate research supervisors 
Supervision of all research  higher degree candidates shall be conducted according to the QUT Code of Good  Practice for Postgraduate Research Studies and Supervision ( D/5.4 ) (see also D/2.6 QUT Code of Conduct for  Research ). Supervisor accreditation has been implemented at QUT. It  establishes a base line of qualifications for supervision across the University  and acknowledges the continuing involvement of supervisors in research  training.
Research Degrees Committee, on  the recommendation of the relevant head of school and executive dean of  faculty, will in exceptional circumstances consider and approve an application  from a staff member who is not a member of an approved research structure, or  external to the University, to supervise a doctoral student.
If approved, the supervisor's  name will be added to the QUT Register of Approved Research Supervisors  maintained by the Secretary, Research Degrees Committee.
Approval authority for PhD  supervision and responsibilities of supervisors are described in the PhD Regulations (MOPP Appendix 9) .  Supervisors are approved by heads of school for the purpose of Masters  (Research) and Professional Doctorate (Research).
Top 
5.1.5 Postgraduate research programs infrastructure 
QUT is committed to ensuring that students have access to the appropriate resources for
  effective and timely completion of their research studies. To this end arrangements can be set in place
  for students to study at QUT using on campus facilities, to access facilities offered by organisations
  associated with QUT on or off campus, or to study externally using the resources of an external organisation
  with support from an external supervisor.
Top 
5.1.6 Quality assurance and standards 
Policy on postgraduate  research studies is strongly influenced by the Australian Universities Quality  Agency and the Australian Government's Research Training Scheme guidelines and  Research Quality Framework. QUT endorses the Australian Universities guidelines on Procedures to  Ensure the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Degree Studies, on which QUT has  based its own Code of Good Practice for Postgraduate Research Studies and  Supervision at QUT ( D/5.4 ) and Research Training Quality Assurance System. 
QUT's Research Training Quality Assurance System:
  provides a structure for QUT's management of research training 
  enhances current practice in postgraduate supervision 
  leads to improvements in the research experience and employability of postgraduates 
  supports timely completion of research  higher degree study 
  provides a practical framework for faculties in their delivery and improvement of postgraduate research programs through approved research structures, and 
  provides the basis for advocacy of QUT's research training achievements. 
The Research Training Quality  Assurance System is available from the Research Students  Centre website.
