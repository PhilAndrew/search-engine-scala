Modification History 
9.6.1 Hepatitis B 
Certain work or study-related activities may increase the risk of  contracting Hepatitis B for some staff members or students. Queensland Health advises  that staff or students may have a greater chance of contracting Hepatitis B if,  during their work / study, they handle potentially infectious human body fluids  such as blood or body substances.
  Individuals who may be required to work in Queensland Health's facilities must 
  be appropriately vaccinated (for example, against Hepatitis B) and provide proof 
  of their immune status on completion of the course of injections. Queensland 
  Health will exclude from their facilities persons who wish to undertake processes 
  or procedures which carry disease contamination risks, unless they produce evidence 
  of their vaccination status prior to their first visit.
It is the responsibility of faculties / divisions / institutes to conduct  and document a risk assessment of work and study practices which may lead to  exposure to infectious diseases. Where such risk requires certified vaccination  of individuals, faculties / divisions / institutes should develop appropriate  local procedures to manage the certification and documentation process.  Faculties / divisions / institutes will need to identify in advance any adverse  work / study consequences for staff and students who are not vaccinated in  accordance with the requirements of Queensland Health.
Vaccination
Hepatitis B vaccination is available to QUT staff and students through QUT  Health Services. Staff members whose positions may place them &quot;at  risk&quot; will be provided with vaccination at no cost to the staff member.  The cost of the vaccination will be met by the staff member's organisational  unit and written authorisation from the relevant manager to QUT Health Services  is required. Examples of &quot;at risk&quot; positions include some School of  Life Science researchers, Facilities Management plumbers, Faculty of Health nursing  and podiatry practitioners, and QUT Health Services medical and nursing  practitioners.
Students whose study requirements meet Queensland Health criteria outlined  above are also considered &quot;at risk&quot; . Heads of school must inform  such students well in advance of possible exposure and of the Queensland Health  requirement for certified vaccination. QUT will provide vaccination through QUT  Health Services with the cost being met by the student unless otherwise  arranged. Course material supplied to students should highlight this  requirement.
For other QUT staff and students, whose work or study-related activities do  not put them in &quot;at risk&quot; positions, QUT Health Services can provide  vaccination with the cost being met by the staff member or student.

9.6.2 Other communicable / infectious diseases 
The general public and the University community may be subject to diseases  which spread from person to person or from animals to persons. As identification  and treatment of such diseases is subject to new information from time to time,  the preferred source of information is the individual&rsquo;s medical practitioner or  the appropriate unit in Queensland Health. The Queensland  Health website provides information on other forms of hepatitis, tetanus  and viral or bacterial infections. See also the HR Health and Safety  Advisory Services website.
Risk assessment of immunisation requirements is based on work tasks and  potential exposure to communicable diseases or biological hazards.
Information on the management of communicable or infectious diseases is  provided on the Division  of Administrative Services website.Top
