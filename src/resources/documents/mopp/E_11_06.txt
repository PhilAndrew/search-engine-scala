A faculty/school may provide an international student with a
scholarship to cover the full fee costs of a course or waive all
or part of the full fee costs or admit a student on a
concessional basis. In these circumstances, the cost of fees
including the capital component must be met from funds other than
those provided through Commonwealth grants.
