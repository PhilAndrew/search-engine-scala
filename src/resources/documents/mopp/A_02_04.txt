2.4.1 Context 
The QUT Quality Framework describes an integrated approach  to leadership and management aimed to support sustainable organisational  development and institutional success. The Framework articulates the key areas of QUT business and how  continuous improvement mechanisms facilitate the achievement of strategic goals  and priorities articulated throughout the QUT institutional plan.
The QUT Quality Framework  provides the University with a systematic and  structured approach to assess and continually improve current performance as  well as providing insight to future success in the key areas of
  Vision, Goals, and Leadership
  Governance and Planning
  Students Learning and Teaching
  Research and Innovation
  People, Culture and Sustainability.
The QUT Quality Framework is based on a set of principles,  which inform these key areas and includes a system of ongoing review and  assessment based on the Quality Improvement Cycle.

2.4.2 Policy outcomes 
The QUT Quality Framework is designed to deliver the  following outcomes
  to provide a clear articulation of QUT's integrated approach to quality assurance  and continuous improvement at a strategic, operational and individual level across  the University
  to deliver an evidence-based approach to continuous  improvement
  to create a culture of continuous improvement  across the University that is embedded in everyday practices.

2.4.3 Principles of the QUT Quality Framework
QUT's Quality Framework is based on the following principles
  clear       alignment with University priorities and focused on the sustainable       achievement of goals
  an overarching cycle of continuous improvement  which can be applied throughout the University
  the systematic use of qualitative information and  quantitative data for identifying improvement opportunities, monitoring impact,  and judging the effectiveness of quality improvement interventions
  a focus on the development of an agile, adaptable  and responsive workforce based on a culture of continual improvement,  innovation and learning
  valuing the involvement of the communities served  by the University as stakeholders in quality improvement. 
Faculties, divisions and institutes will develop quality  systems and processes in the context of QUT's vision and Quality Framework,  specify the requirements of the University's communities (internal and  external), design products, services and procedures in light of these  requirements, and allocate University resources and facilities so that these  requirements are met.

2.4.4 The Quality Improvement Cycle
The Quality Improvement Cycle is a consistent approach to ongoing quality assurance and improvement using the Approach, Deployment, Results and Improvement (ADRI) quality assurance model. The ADRI quality assurance model is used
   &bull; to determine and evaluate performance indicators
    &bull; to identify opportunities to improve systems and processes in key areas of organisational performance
    &bull; to evaluate an organisational area's achievements.
 ADRI provides an organisational area with an opportunity to explore the linkages between policy, practice and outcomes, and to demonstrate progress towards the achievement of the intended vision and goals.
See the Planning and Budget website for a full description of each component.
The Quality Improvement Cycle can be applied to any activity at any level within the University
   &bull; Individual action level: Application of quality improvement can occur in relation to an individual's interaction with a process or activity. For example, it could involve thinking about how to do something (approach), doing it (deployment), observing the outcome (results), and taking action to ensure that the actual outcome aligned with the planned outcome (improving). It is about individuals doing things better to help improve the overall quality of the University's operations.
    &bull; Operational level: At the operational level, there is a focus on ensuring that the University's core business activities are conducted with maximum effectiveness and efficiency. Operational quality requires both individuals and teams to be engaged with continuous improvement, innovation and learning.
    &bull; University level: Quality improvement at the University level involves visioning, governance and planning. It affirms QUT's identity as a university, and tracks the University's progress towards the achievement of goals as outlined in the QUT Blueprint and top-level plans.
 It is recognised that some of the quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms and requirements in use at QUT use differing terminology from the Quality Improvement Cycle; however their intent is consistent.

2.4.5 Benchmarking
Internal and external benchmarking is integral to quality improvement and provides verifiable performance results currently and over time. QUT undertakes a continuous improvement approach which incorporates self-evaluation, internal and external review, and benchmarking against relevant national and international organisations to compare, evaluate and enhance performance.
QUT's benchmarking approach
   &bull; complements the QUT Quality Framework and University Planning Framework (A/2.2) and supports the systematic and structured approach to assessing and continually improving current performance
    &bull; establishes good practice and identifies areas of best practice
    &bull; aims for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and is targeted at specific University activities
    &bull; is evidence-based, applying to all facets of the University's operations, and is both strategic and operational in focus
    &bull; informs planning processes
    &bull; identifies opportunities for performance improvement.
 The Planning and Budget website provides detailed information and resources including a benchmarking registry to support all QUT benchmarking activities.Top
