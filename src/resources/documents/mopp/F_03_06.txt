Modification History 
3.6.1 Coordination of visits 
It is  important that QUT maintains positive relationships with secondary schools.  This relationship is enhanced when outreach and communication to school staff  is planned and coordinated. The Student Recruitment Unit, Marketing and  Communication  Department, manages the school liaison function at a corporate level for QUT  including a school and campus visit program, guidance officer events and  publications, and events for school principals.

3.6.2 Communication with guidance officers 
All communication with guidance officers or secondary school principals must be approved by the Marketing and  Communication  Director.
Top 
3.6.3 Faculty visits 
Schedules of faculty initiated visits to schools or on-campus events for secondary schools should
  be included in the annual faculty marketing communication plan (see 
F/3.1.2
). Proposals for visits
  or events not included in the annual plan are approved by the Marketing and  Communication  Director.
