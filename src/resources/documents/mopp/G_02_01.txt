2.1.1 Variation of trusts and gifts 
In exercising  its power to acquire, hold, dispose of, and deal with property, the University  may agree to and carry out any conditions of a gift, grant, bequest, devise  etc. Council may create any trust or other fund for this purpose, as provided  under Part 5 of the 
Queensland University of Technology Act 1998
(the QUT Act).
The Division  of International and Development (Alumni and Development Office) receives all bequests,  donations and gifts on behalf of the University.
Under Division 1 of Part 5 of the QUT Act, the University may propose the  alternative use of funds remaining after the original purpose of a trust or  gift has been met or where it is no longer possible to carry out the stated  purpose of a trust or gift.

2.1.2 Privately funded academic positions 
The Vice-Chancellor or, where appropriate, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), approves the creation
  of privately funded academic positions at senior lecturer level or above, in accordance with policy
B/3.3
. These positions are funded by industry, commerce, statutory authorities, other bodies or individuals
  and may be named after sponsors at the discretion of the Vice-Chancellor or Deputy Vice-Chancellor
(Academic).
Sponsors agree to meet all extra costs of appointments, including all salary overheads and staffing
    costs associated with consequential reduced teaching loads for appointees and identified costs of
  their necessary resources.
Sponsors pay the funds necessary to support the appointment for the period of the contract into a trust
  account.
When funds for sponsored positions are received from a contributor, the appropriate organisational
  area is entitled to draw on the funds in terms of the conditions laid down on use of the funds.
