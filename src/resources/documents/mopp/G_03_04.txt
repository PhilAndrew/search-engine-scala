3.4.1 Policy statement 
QUT may borrow, with the approval of the Treasurer of Queensland, in  accordance with Part 5 of the Statutory Bodies Financial Arrangements  Act 1982.
The principles applying to borrowings are as follows:
  Council,  following recommendation from Planning and Resources Committee, recommends all borrowings to the Treasurer of Queensland for approval via the Office of Higher Education; 
  borrowings must be in Australian currency and undertaken in Australia; 
  borrowings will generally be from Queensland Treasury Corporation (QTC), with any guarantee or conditions being approved by the Treasurer of Queensland; 
  funds required to meet borrowing repayments are to be accounted for in the triennial budget and commitments are to be reported in the University's Financial Statements; 
  the University's liquidity level is to be maintained at all times to meet all reasonably anticipated operating cash flow requirements of the University, as and when they fall due; and 
  total borrowings should be a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates wherever practicable.

3.4.2 Borrowings 
Borrowings may be approved in the following limited circumstances:
  to further the University's research activities and to commercialise intellectual property; 
  to support the Asset Management Program; 
  to address unexpected shortfalls in cash flows (limited to the QTC Working Capital Loan Facility on 30 day terms).
The  Director, Corporate Finance has delegated authority, following endorsement of  each request by the Vice Chancellor, to approve access to funds from the QTC  Working Capital Loan Facility for up to 30 days and within pre-approved  limits.
All  other borrowings require Council approval following recommendation from  Planning and Resources Committee. Such recommendations are to include a  detailed business case clearly identifying the benefits of the loan, including  a detailed cash flow projection prepared on a discounted cash flow basis.
All  borrowings are approved within the context of the published University  Consolidated Budget and Asset Management Plan.

3.4.3 State government borrowings program 
QUT has access to loan arrangements through Government funding programs (eg  Smart State Research Facilities Fund, State Borrowing Program for Universities) which adhere to the borrowing principles listed above. Specific terms and  conditions relating to these loans are available from the Director, Corporate Finance.Top 
3.4.4 Records and reporting 
The  Director, Corporate Finance ensures that all borrowings are recorded in a  central register and that source documents are safeguarded.
