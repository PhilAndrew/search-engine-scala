Modification History 
University Human Research  Ethics Committee is a Vice-Chancellor's committee established in accordance  with   Council Procedure 1 (Committees) and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human  Research . University Human Research Ethics Committee is  accountable to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation) for  fulfilling the following terms of reference.
Terms  of reference
  University Human Research  Ethics Committee manages risk and ensures compliance with requirements of the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human  Research and the QUT  Code of Conduct for Research and specifically:
  approves, requires amendment of, or rejects,       research projects involving human participation on the basis of       consideration of the ethical implications, compliance requirements, and       the scientific or educational merit of the proposed research; 
  monitors the conduct of approved research       projects until their completion so as to ensure continued compliance with       relevant requirements, and may withdraw approval; 
  advises the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and       Commercialisation) on issues arising from research involving human       participation, including on procedural matters; 
  develops policy and guidance relating to ethical       issues arising from research involving human participation for       recommendation to University Academic Board and University Research and       Innovation Committee, through the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and       Commercialisation).
The Research Ethics Coordinator  maintains a register of proposed and approved activity involving humans.
Membership
The membership of University  Human Research Ethics Committee is constituted in accordance with the  requirements of the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human  Research being:
  A Chairperson, with suitable experience and       senior academic standing - nominated by Vice-Chancellor's Advisory       Committee

  one or more of the members should be experienced in reflecting on and analysing ethical decision-making.
In addition to this minimum  membership QUT makes the following membership provisions:
  Other expertise or knowledge -   to ensure University Human Research Ethics Committee has access to the expertise necessary to review matters before it, nominees may be called onto the committee   from outside the University Human Research Ethics Committee membership
  One nominee of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Committee 
  Research Ethics Coordinator ex officio (rights of audience and debate only) 
A nominee of the Registrar is  secretary.
The National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human  Research permits a committee to consider applications where there  is less than full attendance of the minimum membership at a meeting, as long as  the absent members have received a copy of the application(s) and the Chair is  satisfied, before a decision is reached, that they have had adequate  opportunity to comment upon them.
Alternate members may be  appointed in each membership category with full membership rights. Alternate  members may attend a meeting when:
  the ordinary member is unable to attend a  meeting, or 
  a project from the ordinary member is scheduled  to be considered at a meeting. 
When the Committee is  considering applications for ethical clearance, only members within the minimum  membership will have voting rights. Other members have rights of audience and  debate only.
Deputy  Chair
  In addition to the usual  duties of a deputy chair, the Deputy Chair of University Human Research Ethics  Committee acts as chair while applications or other matters involving the Chair  are under consideration.
Tenure  and frequency of meeting
Terms of office are as  detailed in section 6 of Council Procedure 1 (Committees).
University Human Research  Ethics Committee meets at least quarterly.
Reporting
University Human Research  Ethics Committee reports to Council annually,  through the Deputy  Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation), Audit and Risk Management Committee, University Research and  Innovation Committee and University Academic Board. The Committee also reports  to external bodies, such as the Australian Health Ethics Committee, as  required.
Annual reports to Council  should address numbers and types of activities considered for approval and the  outcomes, risk management, any administrative or other difficulties being  experienced, and any requirements for training staff.
