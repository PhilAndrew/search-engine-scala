Modification History 
1.4.1 Use of the QUT seal 
As a body corporate established by the Queensland University of  Technology Act 1998 (the QUT Act), the University has a seal as an identifier of its status as a body corporate.  The QUT seal is used to authenticate documents issued in QUT's name. It is most  commonly affixed to award parchments, but is also affixed to deeds, and  occasionally to other contracts, agreements or memoranda of understanding.
Award parchments are valid only when the seal is affixed. To ensure that deeds are legally enforceable,  they must be executed by QUT under seal in accordance with the specific requirements  of this policy. In other cases, provided  there is no legal requirement to affix the seal, documents such as contracts,  agreements or memoranda of understanding are valid according to their terms  when signed by the appropriate delegate or authorised officer.
Requirements associated with the use of the QUT seal are outlined in  this policy.
Top 
1.4.2 General authority to affix the seal 
QUT Council must authorise for the QUT seal to be affixed to documents. As a matter of general policy,
QUT Council has authorised the Registrar to affix the seal to:
award parchments issued in respect of a degree, diploma or certificate to which a person has been admitted;
a deed to which QUT is a party; and 
a contract where there is a legal requirement that the contract is executed under seal (for example, leases and other land transactions).
Top 
1.4.3 Circumstances in which the Vice-Chancellor may authorise the affixing of the seal 
There may be other occasions when the affixing of the seal is warranted  or required, and although these circumstances will be rare, QUT Council has  delegated responsibility to the Vice-Chancellor to authorise the affixing of  the seal in cases other than those specified in A/1.4.2 above.
In general, the  Vice-Chancellor may authorise for the seal to be affixed to a document if the  matter is formal or of special significance to the University, including strategic  or diplomatic agreements with major institutions. The Vice-Chancellor may, for  example, authorise the affixing of the seal to a major memorandum of  understanding, despite the fact that such a document has no legal force (for  further explanation on MOUs, see MOPP G/6.1 ).
Top 
1.4.4 Safe custody of the seal 
The Registrar is responsible for making appropriate arrangements for the safe custody of the QUT seal.
Top 
1.4.5 Execution of documents to which the seal is affixed 
When the QUT seal is affixed to a document (other than an award  parchment), it must be signed by the Vice-Chancellor (or the Chancellor) and  countersigned by the Registrar, irrespective of the usual delegation which may  apply in the Schedule of Delegations and Authorities. In this case, sufficient information should  be provided to the Registrar to enable that officer to determine the  appropriateness of executing the document under seal on behalf of QUT (see 1.4.8  below).
The following sealing clause must be inserted at the end of a document other than an award parchment–
The seal of the QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY was fixed
to this document on the .......... day of .................. ......... by
          the authority of the QUT Council.
Chancellor/Vice-Chancellor
Registrar
Top 
1.4.6 Award parchments 
Degrees, diplomas and certificates are conferred by the Registrar on delegated authority from University
  Academic Board under the authority of Student Rule 45(3). An award parchment must state that the document
  is “given under seal” and the
  seal must be affixed. Parchments must be signed by the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Registrar, though
QUT Council has authorised for the signatures to be reproduced by electronic means.
The Corporate Identity Manual specifies the format and presentation for award parchments. See also

E/10.2

1.4.7 Power of attorney for execution of deeds 
Under the QUT Act, QUT has the power to  appoint agents and attorneys, and may therefore delegate its power to enter  into deeds by appointing attorneys either generally or in relation to specific  deeds. QUT Council may, if the  circumstances warrant it, authorise a person or officer acting on behalf of QUT  to sign deeds under a power of attorney in relation to specified classes of  deeds. For this authority to be valid,  the person or officer is appointed in a document executed by QUT under  seal.
All appointments of attorneys for execution  of deeds must be recorded in the Schedule of Authorities and Delegations.
Top 
1.4.8 Responsibilities for management of obligations  
The signatories for deeds or other contracts, agreement or MOUs executed  under seal are derived from the formal requirements set out in this  policy. General responsibilities  associated with negotiation, risk management, and management of obligations and  performance once the document is executed, remain with the usual delegate or  operational area (dependent on the subject matter). For further details, see policy on management  of contracts and MOUs (MOPP G/6.1 ) and the Schedule of Authorities and  Delegations.  
Top 
1.4.9 Recordkeeping 
A register of award parchments issued by QUT under seal (including  substitute and replacement certificates &ndash; see MOPP 
E/10.2
) is maintained by Student Business Services Department.
Records of other documents issued under seal are maintained by Records Management Services.
Top 
1.4.10 Reporting to Council 
The Registrar reports to QUT Council annually on the use of the QUT seal (other than for award parchments) and on the execution of deeds under power of  attorney.
Top 
1.4.11 Misuse of the QUT seal 
Except as permitted by this policy, staff or students must not affix, or  attempt or purport to affix the QUT seal to any document.
Unauthorised, attempted or purported use of the QUT seal, or use or  purported use of a seal which so nearly resembles the QUT seal as to be likely  to deceive, may constitute misconduct by a student or staff member, and may be  dealt with under relevant instruments (in the case of a student, QUT Student Code of Conduct (E/2.1) or, in the case of staff, the relevant  industrial agreement or misconduct policy - see MOPP B/8.4 and B/8.5).
