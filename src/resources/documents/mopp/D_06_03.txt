Modification History
6.3.1 Policy  
Scientific  work involving the use of animals (for research and teaching purposes) at QUT  must be undertaken in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of  Animals for Scientific Purposes, which has been embodied in the Animal  Care and Protection Act 2001 (Qld). The purpose of the Australian Code  is to ensure the humane care of animals used for scientific purposes, including  teaching. QUT is accredited to conduct these activities.
Scientific  work involving the use of animals within the University must be approved by University Animal Ethics  Committee, and the applicant must  receive notification of approval before the work can be commenced.
University  Animal Ethics Committee reviews and monitors the conduct of scientific work  involving the use of animals and ensures compliance with the requirements of  the Australian Code of Practice for the  Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and the QUT  Code of Conduct for Research.
Guidelines  to assist with applications for animal based research activities are available  on the Research Ethics  website. The University's policy on research ethics ( D/6.1 ) should also be  consulted for general guidance on the conduct of the research project.
Researchers  who are unclear of their obligations under the Australian Code of Practice  and/or University policy should consult the Research Ethics website, their  supervisor/research team and/or their Faculty Research Ethics Advisor.
