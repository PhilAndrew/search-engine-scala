  Modification History
This statement commits  QUT to sustainable reconciliation between Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander) and non-Indigenous Australian people. The statement recognises  the particular responsibility of educational institutions to redress  disadvantage and to overcome prejudice.
Recognition
QUT recognises:
  that Indigenous Australian people are the custodians of   the land, and a traditional association with the land in accordance with   their laws and customs 
  that this traditional association with, and respect   for, land sustains Indigenous cultures, languages, spirituality, art, law,   and all other aspects of life treasured by, and held sacred to, Indigenous   Australian people 
  the social, political, economic and education   disadvantage experienced by Indigenous Australian people as a result of a   history of colonisation, dispossession, and unjust legislation, policies   and practices 
  the importance of Indigenous cultures to Australia's   heritage and the dynamic contribution made by Indigenous Australian people   to the community and to the University 
  the rights of Indigenous Australian people to   self-determination, to equitable participation in the community and the   University, to equitable access to resources and services, and to be   treated with respect 
  the significance of the reconciliation process in   building new relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous   Australian people. 
Responsibility
QUT acknowledges:
  that for reconciliation to be sustainable over time,   local communities and institutions must support, and be involved in, the   process 
  the particular responsibility of educational   institutions to redress disadvantage through Indigenous education and   research and to overcome prejudice by educating the Australian community   about the cultures and experiences of Indigenous Australian people. 
Commitment
QUT is committed to  pursuing its goals of teaching and learning, research and community service,  and its other activities, in the spirit of reconciliation.

  counter racism by promoting and implementing the   University's policies on cultural diversity and racial discrimination and   harassment, paying particular attention to Indigenous experiences 
  create a University environment that acknowledges   Indigenous rights and interests, and legitimises Indigenous knowledge,   perspectives and practices by ensuring participation of Indigenous   Australian people in appropriate planning and decision-making, and   including appropriate accommodations in organisational practices
