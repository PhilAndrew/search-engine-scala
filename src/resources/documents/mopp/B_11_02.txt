Modification History
    THIS POLICY IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW - 
    CONTACT PRINCIPAL HUMAN RESOURCES ADVISOR FOR FURTHER DETAILS.
Where a position is reclassified (see section 
B/3.4
  due to the addition of new and significant responsibilities and skills, and 
  where the incumbent has grown with the job and the staff member has performed 
  satisfactorily, the position may be reclassified without the appointment being 
  advertised.
Where a position is reclassified due to organisational restructuring or new 
  priorities resulting in minor job changes, the incumbent is appointed to the 
  new position on merit without advertisement. Additional duties may be added 
  or deleted, but the job is not significantly different in either volume or level 
  of responsibility. Change in classification and enhancement in salary range 
  in these cases would be minor.
Should such restructuring cause major job changes, the position must be advertised 
  (see section 
B/4.1.4
Professional staff who progress due to reclassification are progressed to the minimum 
  incremetal step of the new classification level provided that the transfer does 
  not result in a salary lower than their existing salary.
A transfer to any higher level on the scale is regarded as accelerated progression 
  (see section 
B/7.8.3
) and as such must 
  be justified at the time of transfer.
