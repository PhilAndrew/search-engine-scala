    THIS POLICY IS EFFECTIVE AS OF 01.01.2011.
&nbsp; 
5.3.1 Policy principles 
QUT is committed to  maintaining high academic standards in all of its course and unit offerings,  and expects students to conduct themselves in a manner which is fair, honest  and consistent with the principles of academic integrity, particularly when  undertaking assessment (E/2.1).
Courses at QUT promote  ethical behaviour, which includes valuing and promoting truth, accuracy,  honesty, accountability and the code of practice relevant to the discipline or  professional area (C/4.3.3).
The University is  committed to providing clear guidance and assistance to students to ensure that  they understand the requirement to maintain academic integrity and are aware of  the consequences of a failure to do so.
Any actions or practice  by a student which defeat the purpose of assessment is regarded as a failure to  maintain academic integrity and will be dealt with as student misconduct under  the procedures set out in E/8.1.
Top 
5.3.2 Policy outcomes 
This policy is intended to
  define and articulate the importance of maintaining academic integrity
  provide a framework that assists in identifying failure to maintain  academic integrity
  outline methods of determining what constitutes major or minor cases of  failing to maintain academic integrity, and the procedures for dealing with  each.
Top 
5.3.3 Application 
This policy applies to students undertaking  undergraduate or postgraduate coursework studies. Where allegations of a failure to maintain  academic integrity arise in relation to postgraduate students undertaking a  research higher degree, the matter will be dealt with under the University's  Code of Conduct for Research (D/2.6).
Academic integrity issues will be dealt with within the faculty  designated as the "owner" of the unit for administrative purposes.
Top 
5.3.4 Definition of relevant terms 
For the purposes of this policy, &quot;Course Coordinators/Unit Coordinators&quot;  include similar roles in different faculties and QUT International College including  for example Undergraduate Coordinator, Subject Area Coordinator, Discipline  Leader etc.
Top 
5.3.5 Failure to maintain academic integrity 
Failure to maintain academic integrity includes, but is not limited to,  the following.
(a)&nbsp;Cheating  in examinations
Cheating in examinations includes any action or attempted action on the  part of a student which might gain that student an unfair advantage in the  examination. Common methods of cheating include:
  bringing  into the examination unauthorised material 
  having  access to unauthorised written notes either on paper or another object, or on  the student&rsquo;s body, during the examination 
  communicating  with others during the examination through speaking to others or via electronic  means 
  copying  or reading another student's work during the examination. 
(b) Plagiarism
Plagiarism involves representing another person's ideas or work as one's  own. It may also include resubmitting one's own work for another assessment  item.
Common forms of plagiarism include
  direct  copying, summarising, or paraphrasing another person's work without appropriate  acknowledgement of the sources (such acknowledgment must take the form required  by the particular discipline) 
  using or  developing an idea or hypothesis from another person's work without appropriate  acknowledgement 
  representing  the work of another person as the student's own work 
  copying  non-word based material such as diagrams, musical score, audiovisual materials,  art work, plans etc and presenting them as one's own work 
  using  another person's experimental results as one's own or without appropriate  acknowledgment. 
(c) Other  forms
Other forms of failing to maintain academic integrity include, but are not  limited to
  giving or providing for sale one's own work to  another person, company or web-site etc for copying or use by another person 
  misrepresenting, falsifying, misstating or  fabricating data, for the purpose of assessment 
  purchasing  or otherwise obtaining assessment material through individuals, companies or  web-based tools/services
  collusion  or collaborating with others where not authorised in the assessment requirements.
Top 
5.3.6 Determining  minor or major cases of failing to maintain academic integrity 
For dealing with cases of failure to maintain academic integrity, it  must be determined whether the case represents a minor or major breach.
The Unit Coordinator in conjunction with the Course Coordinator (or the  Examinations Officer, Student Business Services, in relation to cheating in  central examinations) is responsible for determining if a case is minor or  major.
The following considerations can be used to assist in assessing whether  the breach is minor or major
  Extent &ndash; how much of the assessment item is in question (for example, a few  sentences or several paragraphs); and what proportion of the marks for the  entire unit does this assessment item represent (for example, 10% or 50-60%)
  Level &ndash; at what level is the student in their course and how long has the  student &nbsp;been at QUT
  Knowledge &ndash; the student&rsquo;s exposure to the accepted practices, and cultural norms &nbsp;(for both domestic and international students)
  Discipline &ndash; what are the accepted practices in the &nbsp;student&rsquo;s discipline and the extent to which  these practices have been made clear to the student
  Recidivism &ndash; whether the student has been found to have breached the principles of  academic integrity in the past
(a) Minor  cases
Minor cases of  failing to maintain academic integrity include, but are not limited to
  incidental  plagiarism (inadequate, incorrect or inconsistent citation and/or referencing  of sources, paraphrasing too close to the original) including minor copying of  material, such as copying up to a few sentences (note that this may sometimes  be inadvertent, for example, if a student mistakes a verbatim transcript in  their notes as their own words)
  copying  of a small number of answers to questions at the end of laboratory practicals
Where it is determined that a minor breach of academic integrity has  occurred, the Unit Coordinator should grade the student as appropriate to the  criteria for the assessment item, and provide an explanation if low marks have  been given against specific criteria relating to appropriate referencing or  acknowledgment of source material. No penalty (as set out in E/8.1.8) is  applied. 
Procedures for dealing with minor cases are found at E/8.1.6.
(b) Major cases
All other cases of failing to maintain academic  integrity are dealt with as major misconduct in accordance with procedures set  out in E/8.1.7. If a major case of misconduct is proven, the Registrar may  impose the penalties set out in E/8.1.8.
Top 
5.3.7 Appeals 
University Appeals Committee considers appeals  on disciplinary matters. A student upon whom a penalty has been imposed under  this policy is entitled to appeal to the Appeals Committee on the grounds  listed in E/8.1.10.
Top 
5.3.8 Recordkeeping and reporting 
Records must be maintained for minor and major cases of failure to  maintain academic integrity, and in accordance with E/8.1.11.
