6.2.1 Policy   
Research  involving the participation of humans at QUT, conducted by staff and/or  students, must be undertaken in accordance with the National Statement on Ethical  Conduct in Human Research. The purpose of the National Statement  is to promote ethical conduct in all aspects of human research. QUT is  accredited to conduct research involving human participation.
University  Human Research Ethics Committee reviews and monitors the conduct of  research involving human participation, and ensures compliance with the  requirements of the National Statement on  Ethical Conduct in Human Research and the QUT  Code of Conduct for Research.
A Human  Research Ethics application must be submitted for the appropriate level of  University ethical review, and the applicant must receive notification that the  proposal meets the requirements of the National Statement before a proposal  commences. Guidelines to assist with applications for human research activities  are available on the Research Ethics website. The University&rsquo;s policy on research ethics ( D/6.1 ) should also be  consulted for general guidance on the conduct of the research project.
Researchers who are unclear of their obligations under the  National Statement and/or University policy should consult the Research Ethics website,  their supervisor/research team and/or their Faculty Research Ethics Advisor.
