Modification History 
6.2.1 Cleaning of buildings 
Facilities Management has adopted a system of cleaning management for its buildings for which the Associate Director - Campus Services is responsible. A mix of in-house and contract cleaning is used to varying degrees across the campuses. Activities such as waste collection, pest control and hygiene services are carried out by contractors and supervised by Campus Services. Further information is available on the 
Facilities Management web page

6.2.2 Catering in teaching spaces 
Food and drink is not permitted in classrooms without the approval of the Timetabling Manager. Catering may be approved for these areas or in other spaces not normally used for the consumption of food or drink in special circumstances, contingent upon arrangements being made with the caterer by the client to remove all catering materials upon the completion of the event, and to perform any cleaning required to return the area to a serviceable condition. If the standard of post-event cleaning is considered to be unsatisfactory by the campus Cleaning Supervisor / Coordinator, the client will be advised by the Timetabling Section and any additional cleaning will be carried out at the cost of the client.
