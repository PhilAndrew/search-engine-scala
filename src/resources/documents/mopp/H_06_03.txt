Modification History 
6.3.1 General waste and recycling 
General and specific waste contracts, which ensure that all waste / rubbish is removed from site, exist for all campuses. On all campuses general waste is collected and aggregated at specific locations by cleaning staff. 
A recycling programme is a component of waste management and the University has implemented systems across all campuses. Details of waste management systems are available on the 
Facilities Management
Web Page. 
Top6.3.2 Chemical / hazardous waste 
A system for the collection, management and disposal of chemical waste exists and is the responsibility of the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences. Individual generators of chemical waste are responsible for the local management of such waste prior to its delivery to the QUT Waste Disposal Officer in the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences where waste is collected ready for disposal by contractor at an approved dumping site. Waste management strategies and procedures exist for each generating area. Further information is available on the 
Facilities Management
Web Page. 
Solvents (including xylene, chloroform, toluene and ethanol) and most liquid waste is disposed of on a regular basis (approximately bi-monthly) or on an 
"as needs"
basis. Solid chemicals and other waste is usually disposed of in December. 
Radioactive waste material should undergo documented disposal by the user adhering to National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines. QUT has a Radiation Safety Officer whose role is to ensure compliance with relevant State regulations (A/9.2.3).
Top6.3.3 Pathological waste 
Pathological waste is collected into specially marked, lockable 120 or 240 litre wheelie bins which are collected under contract from user areas on a schedule that is appropriate to the user. Organisational units requiring pathological waste disposal services must submit a request to the Cleaning Manager, who will arrange pathological waste services. Responsibility for disposal costs and proper local management of pathological waste remains with user areas.
