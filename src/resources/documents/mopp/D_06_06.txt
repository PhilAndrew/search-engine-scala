Modification History 
QUT Institute Biosafety Committee is a Vice-Chancellor's committee  established in accordance with the Gene  Technology Act 2000 (Cwth) and QUT&rsquo;s &nbsp;Council Procedure 1  (Committees).

Activities involving the use of GMOs must be submitted for the appropriate  level of University review, and the applicant must receive notification of  approval before the project can be commenced.
QUT  Institute Biosafety Committee also has an advisory role to faculties, institutes  and the University more broadly in relation to research and teaching activities  involving any substance which poses a risk in the form of a disease transmitted  by air, tissue or blood and body fluids from human and animal sources. Further details are provided in QUT&rsquo;s biosafety  assurance policy (D/6.4).
