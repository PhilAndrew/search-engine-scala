Modification History 
8.2.1 External user charging 
The Executive Director, Finance and Resource Planning, is responsible for
  recommending to the Vice-Chancellor any proposals for external charging. Any
  such recommendation will be contingent upon the proper process for establishment
  of new or revised external charges being undertaken by the responsible organisational
area, according to the procedures in 
G/8.1
At the completion of the annual review of user charges, a revised Register
  of User Charges is submitted via the Executive Director, Finance and Resource
  Planning, to the Vice-Chancellor for approval, after consideration by Vice-Chancellor's
  Advisory Committee. Following this, the revised Register of User Charges is
  submitted to Planning and Resources Committee for information.
A proposed external charge which is not approved and registered may not be
  levied.

8.2.2 Definitions 
An External User Charge is raised when a faculty/division charges an external
  user of a good or service, produced within the Queensland University of Technology
  or procured by the University, which is outside or ancillary to the mainstream
goods and services of the University.
For the purposes of this policy, an external user is defined as
A person not acting on behalf of the University - this includes
Employees of the University using goods or services for private purposes
Students of the University using goods or services for private purposes
Members of the general public
A student currently enrolled in a non-award course at the University.
Students enrolled in award courses at the University are considered under 
G/8.4
Top 
8.2.3 Principles for external user charging 
External users are required to pay for goods or services supplied by the University.
However, the University shall not require payment where
The service is for the benefit of the general public or is exclusively
    for the benefit of users assessed as not having the capacity to pay
A charge is precluded by legislation or Government direction
The transaction is non-routine and immaterial in amount
The ongoing administrative costs of charging and revenue collection exceed
    the expected long term efficiency gains.
Furthermore, where a service provides benefits not only to specific users,
  but encapsulates a wider community / public benefit, that part considered to
  be in the public benefit will be provided without charge.
The Financial and Performance Management Standard 2009  requires that in determining the appropriate level of charges, the following  should be considered by the organisational area providing the good or service
  The users have the capacity to pay for the  goods or services
  The users have a choice whether to accept the  goods or services
  The goods or services are available from a supplier other than the department or statutory body
  Supplying the goods or services is required or  permitted by legislation
  The goods or services are supplied for the  benefit of the general public or for the benefit only of users who do not have  the capacity to pay
  The administrative costs of charging and  collecting the charges are more than, or may be more than the revenue  collected
  An agreement exists between the department or statutory body and users about charging for the goods or services
  Charging for the goods or services improves, or  may improve, resource allocation through more economical use of the goods or  services
  Other factors exist that the accountable officer or statutory body considers relevant.
In deciding charges for the goods or services, that  accountable officer can structure user charges to either cover full cost or  decide to charge less than full cost if it is satisfied as appropriate.
Further information in relation to these pricing requirements, including definitions
  of direct and indirect costs is provided in 
G/8.1.5
  Information about methods of charge calculation for external charges (including
  Category A, Category B, Category C, penalties and fines, and donations and
  contributions) is available in 
G/8.1.4
All pricing options are appropriate for the calculation of external user charges
  (see 
G/8.1.4
  GST should be included in the price calculation for all external user charges
  unless deemed to be GST exempt as per 
G/8.1.5
(c).
QUT is required to adhere to the requirements and principles of the National
  Competition Policy in terms of competitive neutrality through full cost pricing
  of the good / service offered on a competitive basis. Inclusion of all costs
  will ensure the price is comparable to external providers of a similar good
  / service.
An analysis of pricing options must be undertaken by the organisational area
  levying the charge where:
An active market exists for the goods or services (in such cases the higher
    of full cost or market price shall apply)
The particular University activity operates as a business undertaking
    and is seeking to utilise excess capacity, in which case normal commercial
    pricing considerations apply
The State Government has directed that a particular charge or method of
    charging shall apply
Differential pricing for the purposes of cross-subsidisation has been
    approved by the State Government.
