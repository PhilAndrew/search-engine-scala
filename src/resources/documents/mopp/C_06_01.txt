6.1.1 Policy  principles
QUT promotes a campus-based learning environment  which incorporates blended learning approaches.
QUT is committed to providing high quality learning  environments that
  promote a balance  and blend of learning environments to support QUT&rsquo;s learning and teaching  priorities (as described in the Learning and Teaching Plan &ndash; see C/1.2)
  capitalise on  both physical and virtual innovations to support new approaches in pedagogy and  learning support
  provide  appropriate practical and specialised facilities to support QUT&rsquo;s commitment to  real world learning
  integrate  structures, resources and emerging technologies to provide effective support  for student learning.
Top
6.1.2 Policy  outcomes
This policy is designed to promote:
  a framework for  the design, development and review of physical and virtual learning  environments which supports QUT&rsquo;s commitment to diversity, student engagement, and  real-world learning (see C/4.2); and
  clear and  consistent strategies for the use of learning environments.
Top
6.1.3 Physical learning environments
QUT gives priority to the provision of physical  learning environments which allow a high degree of engagement on the part of  the learner, and support good pedagogical practices on the part of the  teacher.   To this end QUT seeks to  support a range of facilities including traditional lecture theatres,  laboratories, practical working spaces, and flexible learning spaces which  incorporate appropriate technology and services.  
Design of new and upgraded physical space for  learning is based on QUT&rsquo;s design standards (H/4.1) and protocols for the Future Design of Teaching Space  (see http://www.fmd.qut.edu.au/operations/design_standards.jsp).

6.1.4 Virtual learning environments
Virtual learning environments are designed to  support teaching and learning and include the QUT learning management system,  systems for student collaboration, simulation and visualisation software, and  three-dimensional virtual environments.   Virtual learning environments may be combined with face-to-face activities  or, for some courses, may constitute the totality of the learning  environment.
(a) Student access
QUT seeks to optimise student access to globally  available resources through the internet.   Limitations on student internet access are continually reviewed, with  arrangements made to optimise access where more intensive use of such resources  is required (see F/1.1).
(b) Institutional support
QUT undertakes significant investment in a range of  virtual learning resources, including formally adopted all-of-University  systems such as the learning management system, as well as virtual learning  resources available through the QUT Library.
(c) Staff innovation
QUT seeks to encourage innovation and  experimentation by staff in the use of new technologies for learning and  teaching. Such innovation is particularly encouraged where it seeks to improve  the engagement of students, reinforce real world learning approaches or  encompass interdisciplinary activities.   Innovation in keeping with QUT&rsquo;s commitment to improve the first year  experience, transition to the workplace, and real world engagement is also  central to QUT&rsquo;s strategy for curriculum design (see C/4.2).  
(d) Student-initiated activity
QUT supports student-initiated activity to enhance  flexible access to the curriculum, for example  by facilitating student-initiated recording of lectures (see C/6.4).

6.1.5 Integration of physical and virtual learning  environments
QUT supports the designed integration of physical  and virtual learning environments to provide flexibility in time and location  of learning activities (see C/6.3) as well as enhanced learning experiences provided  through a blending of face-to-face and technologically-supported learning  environments (see C/4.2).  The combination of learning environments will differ  for each unit and is based on the appropriate use of technology to support the  desired learning outcomes for the course and the unit.  The integration of physical and virtual  learning environments should be based on the following considerations
  the desire to design student-focussed learning activities  which support the required learning outcomes
  the extent to which the technology will support  work-integrated and real world learning
  the extent to which the combination of learning  environments allows students to learn in a preferred style, including equity  issues
  practicality, cost and logistical issues such as available  resources, class size, access to technology, and staff proficiency levels.

6.1.6 Roles and responsibilities
(a) Strategic  planning
The development of learning environments is informed  by the implementation of the University&rsquo;s Learning and Teaching Plan.  University Teaching and Learning Committee  provides advice and makes recommendations to reflect good practice in learning  and teaching (see C/2.1).
(b) Physical  learning environments
The planning and management of QUT&rsquo;s physical  facilities is undertaken through a five-yearly strategic Asset Management Plan  which is developed and approved through Planning and Resources Committee and  QUT Council (see H/2.1).  
(c) Virtual learning environments
The planning and management of QUT&rsquo;s virtual  learning environments is undertaken through Information Technology Governance  Committee which advises on strategic issues relating to information technology  and information infrastructure, and monitors and reviews the implementation of  information technology projects, funding allocation, and support and  maintenance activities (see F/1.7).
