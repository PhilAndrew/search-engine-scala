    CONTACT EQUITY DIRECTOR FOR FURTHER DETAILS.    
QUT recognises the changing role of women and men in society, and acknowledges its responsibilities to removing barriers to participation in the University's workforce and academic programs. The University is conscious that increasingly its staff and students are likely to have family responsibilities and that these may often be in conflict with work or study responsibilities.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has recognised that all workers, both men and women, have family responsibilities, and that employers should take those responsibilities into account in the development of work structures (ILO Convention 156 on Workers with Family Responsibilities, Recommendation 165). Australian Government policies and programs have drawn the attention of universities to the fact that provision of child care is an important factor in access to tertiary education. (A Fair Chance for All, National and Institutional Planning for Equity in Higher Education, p32 1990).
QUT therefore recognises that
  provision of child care while parents work or study is a University concern
  family responsibilities impinge on employment and education, and thus are not confined to social or private realms of life
  regardless of marital status, family responsibilities are the concern of adults of both sexes
  students and staff should have access to the same educational and employment opportunities whether or not they have dependent children
  students and staff require a range of quality child care services, eg evening care, family day care, vacation care, occasional care.
