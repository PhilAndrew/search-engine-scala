12.4.1 Principles 
The University recognises the need to provide opportunities for  professional staff members to attend conferences (including seminars or  meetings) of direct relevance to their work. Attendance and participation can  assist staff members to keep abreast of developments in their fields and  establish valuable professional contacts, with resultant benefit to the  University.
Staff members are encouraged where possible to make substantial  contributions to conferences through the presentation of papers or by  participating in official roles.

12.4.2 Eligibility 
Professional staff members with an ongoing or  fixed-term appointment are eligible to apply for conference attendance.Top 
12.4.3 Approval and funding 
Registration, travel and associated costs for conference attendance  are approved by the relevant head of school / department / independent section,  and are normally paid from school / departmental budgets.
The  Professional Development Program (PDP) (see B/12.8 ) also provides an  opportunity for professional staff to obtain financial support (in the form of  a contribution to travel, meal and accommodation expenses) to attend a  conference. &nbsp;Staff classified at  HEW2-HEW6 (inclusive) may apply to have conference registration fees paid  through the PDP scheme.
Leave for conference attendance will not normally exceed one  week.
Top 
12.4.4 Application process 
All applicants must discuss the proposed  conference attendance with their supervisor prior to lodging an application.  The supervisor should at that time offer an opinion as to the relevance of the conference  and whether the application should be considered as a Professional Development  Program.
Applications for conference attendance will outline:
  conference details and fees;
  the actual or anticipated cost of all travel associated with the conference attendance (if applicable); 
  the actual or anticipated cost of accommodation, meals and incidentals (if applicable); 
  details of any other significant costs associated with the conference attendance. 
A staff member in receipt of  financial assistance other than normal salary is required to conform to the  conditions applicable to expenditure of University funds (see G/5 ). Top
