4.1.1 Policy principles 
Curriculum development and approval is an inclusive  and consultative process incorporating expertise from a range of stakeholders  during the design phase and the preparation of documentation to support the  approval decision by the delegated authority (see Schedule  of Authorities and Delegations). Pathways to approval, with varying requirements for  consultation and documentation depending on the scale and scope of the proposed  curricular development, are informed by early assessment of the viability and  risk associated with the curriculum development.
QUT's curriculum  development and approval policy is based on the following principles:
  Curriculum development is consistent with  QUT's vision ( A/2.1  )  and supports the objectives outlined in the University&rsquo;s Learning and Teaching  top level plan.
  Curriculum review, renewal and development is  an integral part of the University's annual strategic planning cycle.
  Approval processes provide the flexibility to  be responsive to market opportunities and incorporate strategic consideration  of market issues, viability and resource implications.
  Widespread consultation with both internal and  external stakeholders will occur during the curriculum development process.
  The curriculum development process provides an  opportunity for a thorough review of the risks and opportunities offered by new  courses, including any financial and resourcing implications.
  Curriculum development processes ensure that  curriculum is based on the principles for curriculum design (see C/4.2 ).
The Learning and Teaching Unit website provides detailed information including procedures and resources to  support the curriculum design, development and approval phases.

4.1.4 Curriculum development and approval  
The curriculum  development and approval process incorporates the following activities. The  specific requirements for consultation, documentation and approval are determined  by faculties, in consultation with the Learning and Teaching Unit, through the  development and consideration of a concept plan or change statement for the curriculum action. 
(a) Planning
Curriculum development requirements and  opportunities should be identified by faculties as part of the annual strategic  planning and review cycle to enable University-wide consideration of strategic  matters relating to courses and to provide an opportunity for relevant  stakeholder input.
(b) Consultation 
Faculties are expected to  ensure that appropriate consultation has occurred before approval. Faculties should make use of the following  opportunities for consultation and advice when developing courses, study areas  and units:
  consideration of strategic changes to a faculty's suite of courses as part of the annual planning and review process;
  consultation with the Learning and Teaching Unit to finalise the approval pathway, required documentation, and extent  and form of consultation;
  advice from Vice-Chancellor's Advisory Committee on significant changes to the faculty's course profile or course  provision strategy;

  consideration of the course proposal by the University Courses Advisory Group where required.

Depending on the scale  and scope of the proposed curricular change, documentation may include the following components:

(d) Implementation and monitoring
Following approval,  ongoing course performance is monitored and evaluated against both internal QUT  performance indicators and external measures of student satisfaction and  professional requirements through QUT's course quality assurance process (see C/4.6 ).
