Modification History 
1.2.1 Centres and institutes 
QUT's strategic policy in relation to research is contained in its Research and Innovation Plan. The
  structural arrangements for research centres and institutes therefore support the Plan's key objectives
  of:
research excellence;
high impact outcomes in industry / end-user collaboration;
graduation of high quality research students meeting the needs of industry and the
    professions; and
continuing to build research culture and capacity through support for areas of potential
      strength, and for individuals including research-only staff.
The terms 'centre' and ‘institute' are employed to give identity to a group of individuals organised
  around a central research purpose and working towards definite and achievable research and development,
  research training and/or community service goals. The terms are of value in communicating internally
  and externally with professional colleagues and the wider community, as well as in gaining financial
  support for a specific program of research or other activity that is the core business of the centre
  or institute or institute.
Faculty research centres, along with schools, provide an avenue for doctoral research and for
  the development of staff research experience, particularly in supervising research students.
QUT recognises that the designation of the title 'centre' to areas of special focus may need to be
  awarded in a flexible manner to accommodate particular needs and objectives within the institution.
Establishment of institutes is expected to have an effect on the role of existing centres, especially
  faculty research centres of participating faculties (see section 
D/4.1
A list of institutes, centres, and other research activities is available on the 
QUT website.

1.2.2 A four-tiered structure 
QUT recognises four tiers of research activity.
Tier 1 - Institutes – multi faculty partnerships
Institutes are formed as University-level entities to achieve research outcomes, in line with the
  University's strategic research plans, which cannot be achieved by faculties operating alone (see 
D/4.1
Tier 2 - Externally funded centres
QUT gives institutional recognition to large, strategic research groups particularly where these have
  external partners and external funding. This tier includes QUT involvement in Cooperative Research
  Centres (CRCs), centres of excellence (COEs) and other large research consortia (LRCs), as well as
  QUT collaborative centres (see 
D/4.2
Tier 3 - Faculty research centres
The third tier comprises faculty research centres which are managed by faculties and are recognised
  on the basis of their ability to meet faculty and University-endorsed guidelines (see 
D/4.3
Tier 4 - Research groups / nodes / laboratories / programs / domains
The fourth tier includes smaller research groups, nodes, laboratories or programs that are established
  by a faculty and recognised by the University. These terms are employed to describe a group of researchers
  and resources underpinning an area of focused research activity within a faculty or across faculties
  (see 
D/4.4
Top 
1.2.3 Use of other terms 
The use of other terms for research entities, such as 'unit', must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor
  or delegated nominee.
