8.7.1 Principles 
Consistent with its equal  opportunity and diversity policy ( A/8.4 ) and the QUT  Reconciliation Statement ( A/8.3 ), QUT&rsquo;s  approach to cultural diversity and anti-racism:
  promotes and encourages awareness, understanding and  appreciation of the differences that exist amongst cultural groups and  acknowledges and celebrates the breadth of experience and resources that  people from diverse backgrounds bring to the University;
  recognises and acknowledges the particular significance  of Indigenous Australian peoples as the original owners of this land;
  recognises the responsibility of educational  institutions to redress disadvantage and to overcome exclusion, bigotry,  ethnocentrism, prejudice and racism; 
  respects and protects the rights of its students and  staff to study and work in a discrimination-free environment.

8.7.2 Responsibilities and commitments
(a) Organisational  culture and environment
  QUT  will take all reasonable steps to provide and support a culturally diverse and  inclusive work, study and research environment. A culturally diverse community  is characterised by a wide range of traditions, languages, beliefs, values,  ideas and practices. Consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  (1948) and with Australian law, the University will make every effort to ensure  staff and students are aware of their rights to have their cultural identity  respected and to be free of discrimination. All members of the University  community have an individual responsibility to ensure that their interactions  and activities with cultures, other than their own, affirm diversity and are  anti-racist.
The University will  provide opportunities to increase respect for cultural diversity, such as  training, events, inter-cultural interaction, promotional materials and open  debate, and ensure that decision-making structures are inclusive.
Through strategic  planning, QUT will monitor its progress towards being a culturally-inclusive  environment. Any complaints that may arise on cultural, ethnic or racial  grounds will be resolved by the University using established processes (see A/6.1 and A/8.5 ).
(b) Human  resources
Managers and supervisors are responsible for  ensuring the workplace and study environment is culturally inclusive and free  from race discrimination and harassment. QUT will facilitate cross-cultural  competencies by providing professional development and learning opportunities  for staff and will recognise those who develop their skills and knowledge in  this area. The University will also support managers and supervisors with their  culturally inclusive responsibilities and monitor their effectiveness in  fulfilling these responsibilities, as well as providing working conditions  which are consistent with the needs of a socially and culturally diverse  community, particularly the cultural and religious obligations of staff.
(c) Curriculum  and students
QUT will develop  and deliver programs which are culturally inclusive in course design,  curriculum content and teaching methodologies. Through these programs the  University is responsible for producing cross-culturally competent graduates  who can engage with multiple perspectives, operate in diverse environments,  work in multicultural teams and understand Indigenous perspectives.Student policies, procedures and  support services, appropriate for a diverse student population, will be  provided as well as targeted support services for specific groups identified as  needing particular support.
(d) Research and  community service
Through public debate,  discussion and by reflecting the values, experiences and images of all the  ethnic and cultural groups within QUT, the University will raise the awareness  and understanding of the wider Australian community of diverse cultures. The University will also encourage research  and community service activities that actively engage with cultural diversity  issues, and are inclusive of and beneficial to diverse groups.Top
