5.4.1 Foreword to Code of Good Practice 
The following Code of Good Practice is a mechanism for assuring quality in research higher degree 
training. It is based on a code published by Universities Australia. The Code is
  based on the principles that society, the University, faculties and institutes, supervisors and students
  all have valid expectations from higher degree studies, and that each party has responsibilities. This
  Code sets out the responsibilities of the University, faculties, institutes, supervisors and candidates.
Elements of these guidelines will be applicable to all postgraduate degrees (and some at undergraduate
  level) containing a significant research component. Some aspects of the guidelines also apply to coursework
  components of higher degrees.
Top 
5.4.2 Responsibilities of QUT  
QUT has the responsibility to establish a policy framework within which faculty policies can be developed.
  It is therefore the University's responsibility to ensure that:
requirements and standards for the particular degree are clearly described;
entry standards are clearly specified, which apply regardless of discipline, and which are set
    to ensure registering candidates are likely to have the capacity to succeed given adequate commitment;
candidates have access to adequate physical facilities and resources for their studies;
the intellectual property rights of all parties including candidates are protected and commercial
    considerations do not override the University's policies on conduct of postgraduate research studies,
    or prevent candidates from meeting all the requirements of the higher degree Regulations, or unduly
    restrict a candidate's freedom to publish;
minimum regular reporting requirements are set and adhered to;
there are procedures by which either the candidate or the supervisor may raise and seek resolution
    of grievances;
standards exist for qualifications, training and support of academic staff who are undertaking
    supervision, and that a process exists by which assistance may be sought (either by the supervisor
    or the student) should it be required;
there are explicit procedures for the examination process, including clear guidelines for examiners
    (and supervisors and candidates) outlining the institution's expectations for the particular degree
    and any requirements for confidentiality;
there are appeals procedures setting out the grounds on which, and means whereby, candidates may
    appeal against the conduct and outcome of the examination and evaluation of their candidature.
there are explicit expectations for the capabilities which research graduates will demonstrate.
Top 
5.4.3 Responsibilities of faculties  
It is the responsibility of the faculty to ensure that:
provisions of the QUT Research Training Quality Assurance System (RTQAS) are implemented;
the candidate meets minimum University entry criteria, and further criteria as considered appropriate
    for the course and appears to have the time, motivation, maturity and capacity to complete the course
    successfully and on time;
the proposed research project is of sufficient scope and appropriate nature to allow reasonable
    expectation that a diligent candidate will satisfy requirements of the degree within the time allocated
    in regulations;
due recognition is given to the research interests and ability of the student in determining the
    project;
the institute, school or research centre or other research partner is appropriate for the research
    to be undertaken, and has the necessary time, space, facilities, equipment, technical and resource
    staff, source material and funding for the work;
the proposed principal supervisor is sufficiently expert and interested in the area of research
    to be able to offer the candidate proper supervision, and is registered according to the faculty's
    Supervisor Accreditation framework;
the workload of the supervisor, in research, teaching, supervision and any other duties, is such
    as to allow sufficient time to give the candidate proper supervision;
proper supervision is provided and maintained throughout the research period;
if the supervisor is to be absent for six weeks or more, a substitute principal supervisor is appointed;
associate supervisors are appointed according to regulations and as appropriate for interdisciplinary
    or highly specialised research projects, as soon as practicable in the development of the candidate's
    research plan, and supervisory responsibility is clearly designated and understood by both supervisors
    and candidates;
an academic staff member within a faculty is appointed to act as a coordinator of research graduate
    studies, to monitor the general progress and welfare of postgraduate candidates, including those
    who are members of an Institute and those undertaking their research in external locations, to monitor
    compliance with administrative requirements such as reporting, and to  facilitate
    resolution of grievances where necessary;
the University's requirements for reporting on the candidature are met, and supported by faculty
    procedures appropriate to the discipline, and that both candidate and supervisors have the opportunity
    to read and comment on each other's reports;
written information is produced and distributed to all postgraduates by the faculty with details
    on requirements and procedures relating to all postgraduate matters administered at faculty level
    including:
grievance procedures, whereby candidates may make representation to the appropriate person or
      body, if they believe that their work is not proceeding satisfactorily for reasons outside their
      control, especially in situations involving problems of supervision or unresolved conflicts between
      candidates and supervisors;
a statement on the facilities and resources available to postgraduates within the faculty and
      within the University (eg library, computing and technical facilities, word processing and computing
      training, statistical advice, English language tuition, health care, personal and career counselling)
      incorporating, where relevant, advice on Institute-based provision;
guidelines on appeals procedures at faculty level, consistent with University policy on appeals
      procedures;
guidelines on authorship and intellectual property and the procedures for monitoring them within
      the faculty consistent with University policy;
University/faculty policy on the timing and mode of presentation of those reports by which a
      candidate's progress is assessed.
mechanisms are in place to promote regular consultation and development of profitable intellectual
      relationships between faculty staff and candidates and among candidates including those who are
      Institute members, and which include:
orientation programs at the faculty or appropriate level for postgraduates and their supervisors,
        to clarify procedures, give advice and discuss the expectations of candidates, staff and the
        University;
seminars on research procedures relevant to postgraduate-level research;
a regular program of graduate seminars in the faculty's research area;
training workshops on occupational health and safety procedures;
seminars or appropriate training in ethical issues and procedures;

5.4.4 Responsibilities of the supervisor 
It is the supervisor's responsibility to:
give guidance about the nature of research, requirements of the degree including the nature and
    extent of an "original contribution", standards expected, choice of research topic,
    planning of the research program, presentation of a research proposal, literature and sources, attendance
    at taught classes, where appropriate, and requisite techniques (including arranging for or providing
    instruction where necessary);
advise the candidate on, and ensure, productive use of the candidate's time especially in the first
    year of candidature;
give detailed advice on the necessary completion dates of successive stages of work, so that the
    thesis may be submitted on time;
establish at the outset, through discussion with the candidate, and maintain, a schedule of regular
    (at least monthly) meetings with the candidate in accordance with faculty policy;
request written work from the candidate on a pre-arranged, regular and agreed basis and return
    such work with constructive criticism within one month or less as appropriate;
monitor carefully the performance of the candidate relative to the standard required for the degree,
    and ensure that the candidate promptly is made aware of inadequate progress or of standards of work
    below that generally expected, by specifying the problems and suggesting and discussing ways of addressing
    them. Notes should be kept of such discussions and actions taken. If the problem is not resolved,
    action should be taken according to faculty and University policy;
monitor the development of the candidate's generic capabilities as described in QUT policy
    and advise the candidate on opportunities for the enhancement of such capabilities;
maintain currency in the knowledge and skills required for supervision through staff development
    activities as laid out in the Faculty Supervisor Accreditation framework;
comment critically and constructively and in reasonable time on the content and the drafts of the
    thesis and, at the time of submission, certify that the thesis is properly presented, conforms to
    the Regulations and is, therefore, prima facie , worthy of examination;
advise the Faculty Research Committee (or equivalent), preferably after general discussion with
    the candidate, of the names and credentials of examiners, who are free from bias, active and knowledgeable
    in the field, and empathetic with the theoretical framework of the thesis;
comply with faculty and University policies on reporting on the candidate's progress and provide
    frank and timely comment;
advise and provide support to the candidate on preparation for and performance in reports and reviews
    required by the University and faculty;
ensure that the candidate is adequately trained in safe working practices relevant to the field
    of research and adheres to the guidelines established by HR Health and Safety Advisory Services and  any relevant authority in places of study and work, including Workplace Health  and Safety Officers (WHSOs) and local health and safety committees (A/9.2);
ensure that the candidate is fully aware of the need to follow ethical practices as laid down in
national and state legislation
national guidelines, and
University policy
and as appropriate to the particular discipline and relevant profession, and as specified by any relevant
    funding body;
arrange as appropriate for candidates to make presentations of their research work in faculty seminars
    and support them in their preparations;
arrange as appropriate for the candidate to meet other researchers in the field, and to attend
    meetings or conferences;
ensure that a candidate whose major work is being conducted away from the University or faculty,
    or in a joint project with a commercial or industrial partner, plays a full and active role in the
    intellectual life of the faculty;
ensure that candidates have adequate access to the necessary human and physical resources, and
    participates as far as possible in intellectual life of the faculty;
oversee the candidate's work to ensure that the design of experiments, and the processes of acquiring,
    recording, storing, examining and interpreting data and preparing material for publication have been
    undertaken by the student;
ensure that the direction of the work is entirely under the control of the University and candidate
    in accordance with University policy, particularly where funds are externally provided or there is
    a commercial dimension to the research;
ensure that agreement is reached between the candidate and supervisor concerning authorship of
    publications and acknowledgement of contributions during and after candidature. There should be open
    and mutual recognition of the candidate's and supervisor's contribution on all published work arising
    from the project. It should not be automatically assumed that the supervisor's name or candidate's
    name will appear on all such published work;
ensure adherence to the University policy and faculty guidelines on intellectual property, and
    fully inform the candidate, preferably prior to commencement of the candidature or in any case as
    soon as possible, of any implications of the project with respect to intellectual property. Where
    there are commercial implications, there may be a need to develop a formal agreement on participation
    in the project (through the Office of Commercial Services), and may be restrictions on communication
    or publication of results or access to the thesis;
ensure that original data are recorded in a durable and appropriately referenced form and stored
    safely for a period appropriate to the discipline.
