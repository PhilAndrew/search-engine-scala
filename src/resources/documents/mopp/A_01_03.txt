1.3.1 QUT's commitment to compliance 
As a public  entity, QUT has a responsibility to identify and comply with all relevant  obligations. Compliance means "adhering to the requirements of laws, industry  and organisational standards and codes, principles of good governance and  accepted community and ethical standards" (Australian  Standard AS 3806 - 2006). 
QUT's  commitment to compliance is demonstrated by
  the  sponsorship and support from QUT Council and Audit and Risk Management  Committee for the University's compliance program
  the  active engagement of  senior management in the identification and management of compliance issues and risks
  the  allocation of resources throughout the University to manage compliance obligations.

1.3.2 QUT  Compliance Program 
QUT's compliance  program is in conformance with Australian  Standard AS 3806 - 2006 - Compliance Programs and is an important element  of the University's corporate governance framework. 
The  compliance program aims to prevent, and where necessary, identify and respond  to, non-compliance with the University's obligations under laws, regulations,  codes and its own organisational standards. An important priority for the  compliance program is to encourage a culture of valuing compliance with  obligations, consistent with the profile of a good corporate citizen.
The  compliance program's general aims are pursued through the following key  elements:
  identification and management of the  University's legal obligations in the  Register of Compliance Obligations
  allocation  of responsibility to the relevant operational areas for ensuring compliance  with obligations
  risk  rating obligations as part of the strategic planning and risk management  processes on an annual basis to ensure awareness of the risk of non-compliance  and to provide a measure of any exposure
  the assessment of how well QUT meets its  obligations, and where and how it could improve, including identification of  any non-compliance and remedial action taken
  promotion and training to staff and management  on the importance of compliance with specific obligations, as well as commitment to compliance as an organisational value in line with the QUT Code  of Conduct
  fostering  continuous improvement in compliance processes across QUT to ensure obligations  are met
   regular  reporting to Audit and Risk Management Committee.

1.3.3 Responsibilities  for compliance 
a) All staff
In  accordance with the QUT Code  of Conduct, and the principle of respect for the law, all University staff should  be conscientious in seeking to comply with relevant obligations in the course  of their duties.
b) Registrar
The  Registrar is responsible for implementation of the compliance program. The  Registrar also sponsors University-wide compliance training programs.
c) Policy  and Compliance Manager 
The Policy  and Compliance Manager is responsible for administering the compliance program,  including
  maintaining  the Register of Compliance Obligations
  facilitating  annual compliance risk reporting through the University's strategic planning  and risk management process
  preparing  annual reports to Audit and Risk Management Committee on major trends or issues  identified during the annual reporting processes
  developing  educative training programs for relevant obligations to raise awareness of the  University's obligations
  providing  advice to responsible officers and other staff on compliance obligations and  issues.
d) Responsible  officers
Responsible  officers are designated for all obligations, and are normally the head of the  operational area allocated responsibility for ensuring compliance with a  specific obligation. There may be multiple responsible officers for certain  obligations.
Responsible  officers are required to
  confirm  that they are seeking, in the course of their operational activities, to ensure  compliance with each obligation for which they are the designated responsible officer
  risk  rate each obligation on an annual basis through the University's strategic  planning and risk management process
  periodically monitor and review the risk treatments identified for each obligation in accordance with the QUT risk management framework, and  report on any incidents of non-compliance and the remedial action taken to  address them, including any ongoing non-compliance issues.
Responsible  officers are expected to maintain a sound knowledge of their designated  obligations, and should convey advice of new obligations or changes to existing  ones to the Policy and Compliance Manager. 
e) Senior  managers
The  management of compliance will chiefly occur within operational areas, and non-compliance  will be dealt with through existing operational level management processes. However, compliance issues will on occasion  necessitate an escalation to senior management because of the nature of the risk  or resources involved. In these cases, it is the responsibility of senior  managers to review the situation and implement remedial procedures to manage  the risks in accordance with the University's Risk Management Framework.
At all  times it is the responsibility of senior managers to remain aware of the  compliance obligations allocated to operational areas under their supervision,  and the designated responsible officer's management of these obligations.
f) Audit and Risk Management Committee
Audit and  Risk Management Committee is responsible for ensuring that it receives an  annual report and ad hoc reporting as required from the Policy and Compliance Manager, and that it identifies and requests follow-up action on any issues of  concern.
g) QUT Council
QUT Council  is responsible  for ensuring that it  receives adequate reporting on compliance from Audit and Risk Management Committee.
Top 
1.3.4 Compliance  procedures, review and complaints handling 
a) Compliance  procedures
Operational  procedures relating to the compliance program can be found on the Compliance Program website. 
b) Review
Responsible  officers must ensure that procedures in place to manage compliance with  obligations are regularly reviewed, as part of their continuous improvement  processes.
The operation  of the compliance program itself will be regularly reviewed by Assurance and  Risk Management Services. 
c) Complaints handling
Complaints  about non-compliance, impacts of remedial action, or other issues arising from  the compliance process are dealt with at the operational management level,  through existing grievance  procedures, Student  Ombudsman's Office, or Whistleblowers legislation.
