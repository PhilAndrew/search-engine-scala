and the procedural information provided on the

  Services website.

7.2.1 Student excursions 
See section 
C/3.1.7
for policy relating 
  to field trips and excursions.
The University will reimburse students for fares, travel and tuition costs 
  associated with attending compulsory excursions, industrial visits, or visits 
  connected with approved project work except in those cases where travel to and 
  from the site could reasonably be regarded as equivalent to and a substitute 
  for normal daily travel to and from QUT.
QUT will not reimburse students for
the use of private motor vehicles on field trips
charges in respect of residential accommodation
costs of external students attending residential schools
accommodation charges and subsistence costs in connection with field trips
expenditure incurred during optional field trips.
Reimbursements are administered by the Corporate Finance Department, on receipt 
  of advice from the faculty.
The University incurs a  responsibility at law in respect of officially sponsored field trips, whether  student attendance is compulsory or optional. As a result, when a charge is  levied on students in respect of officially sponsored trips organised by staff, a  new project account will be opened to administer these funds. Unofficial trips organised  wholly by students are not run through the University&rsquo;s finance system.
  Where contributions to a field trip trust fund sub account exceed the costs 
  associated with the trip, the surplus will be returned to the contributors.
