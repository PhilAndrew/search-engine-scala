3.2.1 Policy principles 
QUT offers the award categories of associate  degree, university certificate, university diploma, university advanced  diploma, and university associate degree, bachelor degree, honours degree,  graduate certificate, graduate diploma, masters degree and doctoral degree.
Policy relating to award courses offered by  QUT is based on the following principles:
  QUT's  requirements for award courses are based on the guidelines provided by the Australian  Qualifications Framework Implementation Handbook
  QUT  supports flexible choices for students through the development of joint  degrees, double degrees, and dual awards
  Courses  developed at QUT adhere to the broad definitions of award classifications in  terms of entry standards, duration, structure, academic characteristics, and  depth and breadth of study (see C/3.2.3 to C/3.3.8 below).
Top 
3.2.2 Sub-bachelor awards 
QUT may choose to offer sub-bachelor awards  in the form of associate degrees which will normally be exit awards only. 
(a) Academic characteristics
Sub-bachelor awards provide students with an  introduction to the foundations of a discipline or across several disciplines.  Students are expected to develop:
  an  understanding of key concepts and theories relating to the foundational  underpinnings of one or more disciplines
  academic  skills necessary to access, comprehend and evaluate information from a range of  sources
  generic  employment-related skills
  a  capacity for self-directed and lifelong learning.
(b) Structure
Sub-bachelor courses are normally sub-sets  of existing bachelor degree awards and the units, academic characteristics, and  learning outcomes are drawn directly from the parent bachelor degree.
QUT also offers four specific sub-bachelor  awards which are available to international students only and which do not  articulate with a parent bachelor degree.
  University certificate &ndash; involves the completion of one semester of full-time equivalent course work (48 credit points) 
  University diploma &ndash; involves the completion of two semesters of full-time equivalent coursework (96 credit points). 
  University advanced diploma &ndash; involves the completion of three semesters of full-time equivalent coursework 144 credit points). 
  University associate degree &ndash; involves the completion of four semesters of full-time equivalent coursework (192 credit points). 
(c) Entry requirements
Sub-bachelor awards require satisfactory  completion of Year 12 in an Australian school system or equivalent, or an  appropriate vocational education and training qualification, as the level of  entry.
Top 
3.2.3 Bachelor degrees 
Bachelor degrees include the following:
  288 credit point degrees (six semesters full-time equivalent) 
  384 credit point professional degrees (eight semesters full-time equivalent) which may be awarded with honours (see C/3.2.12)
  192 credit point graduate entry degrees (four semesters full-time equivalent) 
  96 credit point honours degrees (two semesters full-time equivalent), following a three year degree (see C/3.2.4) 
  double degrees (see C/3.2.9). 
(a) Academic characteristics
Bachelor degree courses provide students  with a systematic and coherent introduction to a body of knowledge, the  underlying principles and concepts, and the associated problem-solving  techniques. Students are expected to develop the academic skills and attributes  needed to comprehend and evaluate new information and concepts from a range of  sources so that after completion of a degree they can continue to review,  consolidate, extend and apply the knowledge gained in their undergraduate  studies. A bachelor degree course includes the provision of major studies in  which a significant literature is available. Course content is taken to a  significant depth, and knowledge is progressively developed to a high level to  provide a basis for professional careers and pathways to postgraduate study and  research.
(b) Structure
A bachelor degree comprises the following:
  Introductory (foundation) units which introduce students to the body of knowledge, skills, and capabilities expected to be acquired during the course, as defined by the course learning outcomes.
  Advanced level units where discipline and professional knowledge and skills, and graduate capabilities are progressively developed to a high level appropriate to the academic characteristics of the award, and providing a basis for lifelong learning. Advanced level units normally include one Study Area A, and the option of at least one Study Area B.
  Opportunities for cross-disciplinary study through a Study Area B in a different discipline area to the Study Area A, optional units, or capstone units. 
QUT encourages the provision of research  pathways within bachelor degrees, such as the Dean's Scholars Programs.
(c) Entry requirements
Bachelor degree courses require satisfactory  completion of Year 12 in an Australian school system, or equivalent, as the  level of entry. Faculties may specify assumed knowledge of specific discipline  areas, and may also set other special entry requirements such as folios or  auditions (see E/4.1.2 ).
(d) Entry pathways
 A number of pathways are available for entry  to bachelor degree courses including:
  entry after satisfactory completion of Year 12 in an Australian school system or equivalent 
  articulation from a Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) qualification such as a Diploma or Advanced Diploma which may involve articulation and advanced standing arrangements 
  entry from another undergraduate degree 
  direct entry via pathways programs. 
Top 
3.2.4 Honours degrees 
An honours degree is a 96 credit point (two  semesters full-time equivalent) bachelor level degree following completion of a  288 credit point bachelor degree course. On completion, students receive both  the award for the bachelor degree and the award for the honours degree. The level of honours awarded is based on the  student's final grade point average (GPA) (see C/5.2.4).
(a) Academic characteristics
Honours degrees offer an additional 96  credit points of undergraduate study following a 288 credit point bachelor  degree and provide:
  a link between undergraduate study and research programs by introducing students to research skills, and/or
  advanced skills for entry into a profession. 
(b) Structure
Honours degrees contain a mix of advanced  theory, professional training (where appropriate), research training, and a  research project leading to a written dissertation or alternative form of  presentation if appropriate.
At least 25 per cent of the credit points  associated with the course must be allocated to a project or dissertation. The  proportion of credit points allocated to a project or dissertation should have  reference to current practice within the relevant discipline nationally.
(c) Entry requirements
Honours degrees require completion of a  three-year bachelor degree with a GPA of at least 5 as the level of entry,  including grades of at least 5 in all units directly relevant to, or specified  as prerequisite for, the proposed honours degree. Applicants who have  demonstrated outstanding performance in only the final year of a bachelor  degree, or whose application is based on other factors including work  experience or involvement in research, may be admitted at the discretion of the  executive dean of faculty.
(d) Entry pathways
Students who wish to undertake an honours  degree must apply for admission at the end of the final year of their bachelor  degree, or within 18 months of completing that degree.
(e) Examination requirements
For  honours degrees, project reports and dissertations are examined by an examining  committee, appointed by the executive dean, and consisting of at least two  examiners, one of whom may be external to the University. The supervisor of the  candidate's work may be a member of the committee but may not chair the  committee or act as the primary examiner. A minimum of three copies of a  dissertation is presented to the supervisor for examination. Dissertations are  temporarily bound in order to facilitate the making of any revisions and  editorial changes required by examiners before final printing and binding. 
Top 
3.2.5 Graduate certificates and graduate diplomas 
A graduate certificate is a 48 credit point  (one semester full-time equivalent) coursework postgraduate course.
A graduate diploma is a 96 credit point (two  semesters full-time equivalent) coursework postgraduate course. In some cases  where there are discipline specific requirements, a graduate diploma may  comprise more than 96 credit points.
(a) Academic characteristics
Graduate certificates and graduate diplomas  are coursework courses that are generally designed for specific professional  purposes to provide graduates and allied professionals with short, focussed  programs and are taught at a level appropriate to a graduate intake. Graduate  certificates and graduate diplomas may be developed in response to needs and  demands to upgrade knowledge in areas of changing technology or expertise.
Graduate certificates and graduate diplomas  will either:
  develop a new academic, professional or vocational area (postgraduate in time), or 
  extend skills and knowledge in a professional area previously studied (postgraduate in level). 
(b) Structure
A graduate certificate will normally consist  entirely of coursework. A graduate diploma may include a mix of coursework and  project work. A graduate certificate may  be designed to include up to 48 credit points of undergraduate units (see C/3.1.8).
(c) Entry requirements
Entry to graduate certificates or graduate  diplomas requires completion of a three-year bachelor degree. In some  circumstances, relevant prior work experience, particularly relevant  professional practice, may be recognised for entry.
(d) Entry pathways
Graduate certificates and graduate diplomas  may form part of a suite of nested courses together with a coursework masters  degree (see C/3.1.8). 
Top 
3.2.6 Masters degrees 
Masters degrees are classified as either  coursework or research and may be:
  96 credit points or 1 EFTSL (two semesters full time equivalent) 
  144 credit points or 1.5 EFTSL (three semesters full-time equivalent) 
  192 credit points or 2 EFTSL (four semesters full-time equivalent). 
(a) Academic characteristics
Masters degrees provide students with an  advanced knowledge of a specialist field of study or area of professional  practice involving theoretical and applied topics. Students are expected to  think rigorously and independently, develop high level skills in analysis,  critical evaluation, and professional application, and creatively and flexibly  apply knowledge and skills to new situations and complex problems.
Coursework masters degrees allow the student  to either develop a new discipline area, or extend skills and knowledge in a  specialist field, usually with an emphasis on the acquisition or enhancement of  professional or vocational skills and knowledge.
Research masters degrees allow the student  to acquire an in-depth understanding in a specialist field through a research  program involving critical evaluation, selection and application of research  methodologies, analysis of literature, and evaluation and interpretation of  results. Guidelines for the requirements for a research masters degree,  including supervision and examination of the research thesis are available from  the Research Students Centre website.
(b) Structure
A coursework masters degree comprises  coursework, project work and research in varying combinations. A project or  dissertation in a coursework masters degree would normally be a maximum of 48  credit points. Credit points for a coursework masters degree will normally be  96 credit points if the pre-requisite is a four-year undergraduate degree or  equivalent, and 144 credit points if the pre-requisite is a three-year  undergraduate degree. Coursework masters degrees of 192 credit points may be  established where there is a discipline requirement for an 'advanced' level of  study provided by an additional 48 credit points beyond the standard 144 credit  point course. A professional coursework masters degree normally involves a  work-based or professional practice project.
A research masters degree comprises  coursework and research higher degree in varying combinations, where at least  two-thirds of the course involves research higher degree and completion of a substantial, externally examined thesis. A  research masters degree may vary between 1 EFTSL (96 credit points equivalent)  and 2 EFTSL (192 credit points equivalent).
(c) Entry requirements
Entry to a masters degree is based on  evidence of a capacity to undertake higher degree studies in the proposed  field.
For a coursework masters degree, entry is  based on as a minimum:
  a bachelor degree or a graduate diploma.
For a professional coursework masters degree  entry may be on the basis of either a relevant qualification and professional  experience, or extensive high-level relevant professional experience.
For a research masters degree, entry is  based on as a minimum:
  a bachelor degree with honours, or 
  a GPA of 5 or better in an undergraduate degree, together with a graduate diploma, a coursework masters degree, or a minimum of one year relevant work experience. 
(d) Entry pathways 
 Possible pathways for entry to a masters  degree include:
  direct entry after completion of an honours degree 
  entry after completion of a bachelor degree and a period of work experience 
  articulation from a graduate certificate or graduate diploma 
  entry based on extensive high-level relevant professional experience. 
Where an 'advanced' 192 credit point  coursework masters degree is established, this would normally form a nested  suite with a 'standard' 144 credit point coursework masters in the same  discipline.
Students with an honours degree entering a  research masters degree may be granted advanced standing for the coursework  component of the course. A research masters degree is a possible early exit  point for students enrolled in a doctoral degree.
(e) Examination requirements
QUT  requires that at least two examiners, at least one of whom is external to the  University, be appointed to examine a thesis presented for a research master  degree. The academic board responsible for the course appoints examiners on  advice from the head of school and/or principal supervisor. Notes for the  guidance of examiners of research master degree theses can be found at the Research Students Centre website. 
Top 
3.2.7 Doctoral degrees 
A doctoral degree is a 3 EFTSL time-based  course (six semesters full-time equivalent).QUT offers both a PhD and  professional doctorates. The PhD is primarily achieved through supervised  research. A professional doctorate involves  varying combinations of research and coursework and may be classified as either  a research higher degree or coursework doctoral degree. Professional doctorates may be developed in  collaboration with relevant professional bodies or other universities.
(a) Academic characteristics
Doctoral degree programs provide students  with the opportunity to carry out research addressing a matter of substance at  a high level of originality and quality. Students are expected to provide a  substantial original contribution in the form of new knowledge or significant  and original adaptation, application, and interpretation of existing knowledge.  QUT encourages a variety of approaches to the selection of topics and  supervisors, and models of supervision. Topics could include multidisciplinary  problems suggested by external bodies (for example, industry, government and  commerce) with joint supervisors appointed from both academic and external environments.
(b) Structure
Course requirements for doctoral degrees are  set out in the Doctor of Philosophy Regulations (MOPP Appendix 9 ) or other relevant regulations for  individual degrees. Individual course requirements for supervision and thesis  examination must be based on the Code of Good Practice for Postgraduate  Research Studies and Supervision at QUT ( D/5.4 ).
Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Professional  Doctorates by Research
For all research doctorates, the expected  outcomes are gained through a comprehensive review of relevant literature,  experimentation, creative work with exegesis or other systematic approach, or  advanced searching and critical reflection on professional theory or practice.
A research higher degree doctorate generally  includes:
  a program of coursework in support of the conduct of the research and preparation of the thesis, where the coursework comprises a maximum of one third of the total program of study (a maximum of 96 credit points)
  participation in University scholarly activities such as research seminars, teaching and publication 
  regular face-to-face interaction with supervisors, and 
  a program of supervised research and investigation resulting in the presentation of a thesis. 
QUT permits the presentation of the thesis  for a doctoral degree in the following formats:
  a thesis presented in accordance with the requirements of the QUT Council with the main body of the text not exceeding 100,000 words 
  published and/or submitted papers, where such papers have been published, accepted or submitted during the period of candidature 
  artwork and exegesis, where the artwork may be in the form of exhibition, performance, literary work, film, CD Rom or other approved format. The artwork and exegesis are examined as an integrated whole. 
Professional Doctorates by Coursework
Coursework professional doctorates provide  extended and advanced training in professional fields, and involve the  candidate undertaking a project or integrated series of projects with a  specific focus on professional practice, together with critical reflective  practice to inform and benefit subsequent projects. A variety of forms of  assessment for projects are encouraged.
For a coursework professional doctorate, the  course generally includes:
  a  program of coursework which is of an advanced postgraduate level providing an  appropriate depth of knowledge, understanding, analysis and skill for the field  of intended research, where the coursework comprises a maximum of two thirds of  the program of study (ie a maximum of  192 credit points)
  participation  in University scholarly activities such as research seminars, teaching and  publication 
  regular  interaction with supervisors, and 
  a  program of supervised research or project work which comprises no less than one  third of the program of study (ie at least 96 credit points) leading to either  the submission of a thesis at the completion of the research / project  component or submission of two theses, one during and one at the end of the  research / project component. A candidate must normally complete the coursework  component with a GPA of 5 or better prior to commencing the research / project  component of the course of study.
Course requirements for professional  doctorates are established by the relevant faculty for each course, and are  approved by University Academic Board. The course requirements for each  professional doctoral degree are set out in the QUT Handbook.
(c) Entry requirements
The minimum requirement for entry into a  research doctorate is either:
  a minimum of Honours IIA or equivalent, or 
  a grade point average of 5 or better in a masters degree course, including the research project component with demonstrated potential for further study and/or evidence of research activity and/or professional standing. 
The minimum requirement for entry into a  coursework professional doctorate is:
  a minimum of Honours IIA or equivalent, and 
  two years practice in a position of professional responsibility appropriate to the proposed course of study. If the candidate does not have professional practice experience, he or she will be required to gain substantial professional experience during the course of the doctorate. 
(d) Entry pathways
All research masters degrees form a nested  suite with the Doctor of Philosophy course provided the student is continuing  studies within the same discipline.
(e) Examination requirements
In the case of a PhD thesis, at  least two external examiners are appointed. University Research and Innovation  Committee appoints examiners on advice from the principal supervisor. Notes for  the guidance of examiners of PhD theses are available from the Research Students Centre web page.
In the case of a doctoral degree  in a specified professional field, a thesis is normally examined by an  examination committee comprising two external examiners and one internal  examiner. The internal examiner normally shall chair the committee.
Top 
3.2.8 Higher doctorates 
The degrees of Doctor of Letters (DLitt),  Doctor of Science (DSc), Doctor of Engineering (DEng), Doctor of Business  (DBus) and Doctor of Laws (LLD) may be awarded by the University.
A higher doctorate may be awarded by  University Academic Board on the recommendation of Research Degrees Committee  for original and substantial contributions of distinction which add to the  knowledge and understanding of any branch of learning with which the University  is concerned.
Procedures for awarding a higher doctorate  are available from the Research Students Centre website.
(a) Academic characteristics
A higher doctorate degree requires the  candidate to provide satisfactory evidence of outstanding scholarship and of an  original, substantial and distinguished contribution to the knowledge,  understanding, practice or creative achievement in any branch of learning with  which the faculty is directly concerned.
(b) Structure
In order to be admitted as a candidate for  the higher doctorate, the candidate must submit published works for  examination. The published work should be seminal in that it has:
  represented a significant advance in knowledge, or 
  been a major part of, or has given rise to a significant debate in, scholarly books and journals, or 
  given rise to significant changes in the direction of research or of practice of a newer generation of scholars. 
(c) Entry requirements
Application to become a candidate for a  higher doctorate is made in writing to the Registrar, detailing the applicant's  grounds for admission, achievements and the work to be submitted for the higher  doctorate. The relevant faculty appoints a committee to determine whether the  work falls within the scope of the faculty and whether the quality and quantity  of work to be presented justifies submitting the work for examination. If the  candidate is accepted, an Examination Committee is appointed.
  Top 
3.2.9 Double degrees 
A double degree may be offered at bachelor  or masters level, and is constructed as a single program of study that allows  the student to complete two awards of the same level within a specified  timeframe. On graduation, students  receive individual awards for each of the component degrees. Double degrees may be developed as a  combination of two QUT award courses or as a joint degree combining a QUT award  course and an award course from another university (see C/3.2.11).
The course structure for a double degree  must be constructed to meet the following criteria:
  Each of  the single component awards have a separate course code to allow for early exit  from the double degree. In certain  circumstances, and if approved by University Academic Board, the single award  may be available as an exit-only award.
  A  student must be able to meet the completion requirements for each of the  constituent single degrees. This is  normally achieved through a course structure which requires students to  complete the core and Study Area A components of each single degree. 
  A  double degree program must not comprise more than 144 credit points (three  semesters full-time equivalent) additional to the number of credit points of  the longer of the two single component degrees. 
  Where  the course completion requirements of the single degrees allow, double degrees must  be constructed so that a combination of two 288 credit point award courses is  completed in 384 credit points, and a combination of a 288 credit point and a  384 credit point course is completed in 480 credit points.
  Applicants  for a double degree must meet the entry requirements of both component degrees. 
  Awards with distinction, awards with honours and  University medals are awarded as appropriate for each of the component degrees.  Faculties make recommendations for these awards based on the same criteria as  the awards for the component degrees (see C/3.2.12, E/10.1 and E/10.4 
Top 
3.2.10 Joint awards 
 QUT encourages collaboration with other  education providers through the development of joint awards where each provider  can contribute a different discipline or perspective to an integrated  course. Joint awards may be established as  either a single course or double degree offered in collaboration between QUT  and one or more other institutions.
Top 
3.2.11 Dual awards 
Dual awards may be  established as a combined qualification with a single entry point leading to  the award of two qualifications at different levels either involving two QUT  courses or a QUT course together with a course offered by a registered  Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) provider. The following requirements apply to dual  awards:
students  are admitted through a single entry point and are given a packaged offer for  both courses
  a quota  must be applied for entry for each dual award
  entry  requirements must include the usual entry requirements for the QUT course (eg  English language standards)
  entry  to the higher level course may be concurrent with the lower level course, or  may require students to complete the lower level course with a particular GPA  before entry to the higher level course is granted
  where  entry is initially to the VTE component, students may be awarded a  predetermined amount of advanced standing on entry to the QUT course
  students  will graduate from the lower level course on completion of the course  requirements.
Top 
3.2.12 Exit awards 
In some cases, an exit award at a lower level  may be possible for students who complete part of a course but do not wish to  progress to completion of the award. Some awards may be available as exit  awards only with no direct entry. Possible  exit awards include:
  An  associate degree may be available as an early exit option from a three-year  bachelor degree.
  A  three-year bachelor award may be available as an early exit option from a  four-year bachelor degree.
  A  nested suite of postgraduate awards may be established such that students can  choose to exit from an incomplete higher level course in the suite, and be  awarded a lower level award on the basis of satisfactory completion of the  requirements for the lower level award.
  Students  admitted to a research doctorate or a professional doctorate but who either do  not qualify to progress to the award, or do not wish to proceed, may on  application be transferred to a masters degree award or the Graduate  Certificate in Research Studies.
