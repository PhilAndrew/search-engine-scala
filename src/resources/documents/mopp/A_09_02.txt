Modification History
9.2.1 Policy principles 
QUT is committed to a health and safety management system which complements the University&rsquo;s health and safety policy (A/9.1). A risk assessment approach to the management of health and safety, which is one of the key elements of the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Qld), has been adopted by the University .
The HR Health and Safety Advisory Services website provides information and procedural guidelines based on legislative provisions relating to health and safety. Staff and students should access health and safety legislation where appropriate. 
Top

Top 
9.2.3 Specific health and safety roles 
(a) HR Health and Safety Advisory Services 
Staff of HR Health and Safety Advisory Services
 develop policy on workplace health and safety matters
 advise managers, health and safety committees, staff and students on workplace health and safety matters
 facilitate the audit of health and safety performance
 arrange and provide health and safety training courses, and
 coordinate health and safety programs for QUT as a whole.
(b) Health and safety professionals
 A number of faculties, divisions and institutes employ full-time health and safety professionals, often with specific hazard expertise, to manage &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; environments and to facilitate the delivery of health and safety programs at the local level. These officers contribute to local policy and protocol development, health and safety training and induction, audit and inspection, risk management, accident and incident investigation, and reporting.
(c) Workplace Health and Safety Officers (WHSOs) and Workplace Health and Safety Representatives (WHSRs) 
Managers should nominate at least one Workplace Health and Safety Officer (WHSO) and encourage the election of at least one Workplace Health and Safety Representative (WHSR) in their area of authority.
 WHSOs provide advice to managers and supervisors on aspects of the Workplace Health and Safety Act (coupled with local knowledge) on a day-to-day basis. These persons are not health and safety professionals and the role is generally secondary to their usual job.
 The statutory functions of a WHSO are to
 describe the overall state    of health and safety for a section 
 conduct regular inspections    of the work area 
 report hazards or unsafe    practices 
 establish educational    programs 
 investigate or assist with    investigation of accidents, illnesses and injuries 
 report such events to HR    Health and Safety Advisory Services 
 assist with the annual    review / audit of health and safety management 
 assist an inspector in the    course of their work. 
WHSRs are nominated and elected or endorsed by co-workers to act as their representative in health and safety matters. WHSRs are entitled to
 inspect their work area    weekly or as negotiated with the employer 
 be advised of work caused    injuries, illnesses or dangerous events 
 be present at worker    interviews if asked by a worker 
 review circumstances of    injuries, illnesses and events and make recommendations to managers,    supervisors or investigators 
 be consulted on changes    proposed to workplace, plant or substances that may affect health and    safety

 report health and safety    issues to the relevant WHSO or employer 
 seek cooperation in    remedying health and safety issues or report such issues to an inspector 
 be a member of the relevant    local health and safety committee
 issue Provisional    Improvement Notices to the person in control of the workplace for    contraventions or likely contraventions of the Workplace Health and Safety    Act within their area of responsibility when cooperation in remedying    issues has not been achieved after consultation. (This entitlement is only    available to WHSRs qualified in course 30630QLD).
(d) Emergency Control Organisation (ECO) members 
ECO members (ie wardens) are required to carry out the following functions: 
 attend initial warden training or annual refresher warden training
 participate in a minimum of one out of two scheduled building evacuations per annum
 perform workplace inspections and submit monthly workplace fire safety housekeeping reports in the approved form
 attend a minimum of one out of two half yearly meetings convened by the chief warden on fire safety and emergency preparedness in the workplace
 provide input into the Building Fire and Evacuation Plan (this document is written and reviewed annually by the chief warden in conjunction with all members of the ECO team).
In addition, chief wardens and deputy chief wardens are required to attend an annual meeting convened by the Emergency Response Coordinator, Facilities Management Department, on fire safety and evacuation preparedness in the workplace.
Chief wardens are also required to
 convene two half-yearly    meetings on fire safety and emergency preparedness in their building 
 implement a Building Fire    and Evacuation Plan
 provide monthly workplace    fire safety housekeeping reports
 coordinate building    evacuations, and 
 ensure the adequacy of ECO    equipment.
(e) First Aid Officers 
 Staff members who hold a current first aid certificate may be appointed by the manager of their organisational area as a Designated First Aid Officer after the conduct of a risk assessment as per the First Aid Code of Practice 2004. Normally, a Designated First Aid Officer will not also be nominated as an ECO warden. If such a dual role is unavoidable, the warden role has precedence in an emergency. Additional trained first aid officers can be nominated as Voluntary First Aid Officers and can assist with the delivery of first aid services, particularly in the absence of the Designated First Aid Officer. First aid provision at QUT is detailed in the first aid and medical emergencies policy (A/9.5). 
(f) Radiation Safety Officer 
 The Radiation Safety Officer, located within the Faculty of Science and Technology, is approved by Queensland 's Department of Radiation Health. In accordance with the Radiation Safety Act 1999, the Radiation Safety Officer advises, monitors and reports on the use of materials or equipment which emit significant levels of ionising or non-ionising radiation. The Radiation Safety Officer is responsible for ensuring the provision of appropriate training (at cost) and the coordination and submission to the Department of Radiation Health of the respective QUT Radiation Safety and Protection Plans. Staff wishing to purchase radioactive materials or equipment must advise the Radiation Safety Officer prior to purchase. The Radiation Safety Officer has authority to take control of sources of ionising or non-ionising radiation on behalf of the Executive Dean, Faculty of Science and Technology, if the sources are
 being used in a dangerous or    improper manner 
 improperly stored 
 &quot; derelict &quot; or    not held under the direct control of an appropriately qualified person or    licensed user, or 
 in a dangerous, deteriorated    or unsafe condition. 
The Radiation Safety Officer reports on activities to the QUT Lead Health and Safety Forum.
Top 
9.2.4 Emergency Control Organisations 
Each building is required to have an Emergency Control Organisation (ECO) consisting of a chief warden, a deputy chief warden and at least one warden per floor. The actual number of wardens required is determined through a documented risk assessment process conducted by the managers of the organisational areas occupying space within the building. Managers should consider the following factors when conducting their risk assessment
 proximity to other QUT    facilities 
 the size, layout, age and    nature of the space, and the number of fire exits
 the type of work performed    in the space 
 the pattern of use    throughout the day 
 the nature of the people    using the space (eg teaching / research / professional or a combination of    these). 
More information on risk assessment may be found in QUT&rsquo;s risk management policy (A/2.5).
The wardens required for each building, including chief wardens and deputy chief wardens, are appointed by the Security Manager following nominations by workplace managers in each building. Security staff train wardens and audit their performance.
Appointment to an ECO is a legislated function that has precedence over normal duties in the workplace and appointees must be released from their functional duties to attend training and to perform the activities of a warden.
Organisational areas are responsible for the issue and replacement of ECO equipment. Details of ECO equipment are contained in the Emergency Procedures Manual. 
Top 
9.2.5 Recognition of health and safety roles 
Staff who voluntarily perform formal health and safety roles are eligible to receive two days special leave per annum subject to meeting the eligibility requirements outlined on the Human Resources website. In approving the two days special leave available to staff in voluntary health and safety roles, managers are acknowledging that the duties listed above (A/9.2.4) for the various health and safety roles have been discharged.
Performance of formal health and safety roles may involve additional workload and resource allocation and should be included as part of the staff Performance Planning and Review (PPR) process (B/9). 
Top 
9.2.6 Workplace health and safety committees 
Workplace health and safety committees are identified by the Workplace Health and Safety Act as the preferred mechanism for facilitating consultation between management and staff with the aim of preventing injuries and illnesses. Workplace health and safety committees should seek to
 encourage and maintain at    the workplace an active interest in health and safety 
 consider measures for    training and educating persons at the workplace about health and safety    issues including documented local safety inductions 
 inform workers about the    formulation, review and distribution (in appropriate languages) of    standards, rules and procedures relating to health and safety 
 review circumstances    surrounding work injuries, work caused illnesses and dangerous events    referred to the committee for review having regard to the legal    definitions of those terms (see Workplace Health and Safety Act - Schedule    3, Dictionary) 
 inform the employer of the    review results and make recommendations arising out of the review 
 assist in the resolution of    issues relating to workplace health and safety. 
QUT has a system of health and safety committees comprising
  the QUT Lead Health and    Safety Forum (see A/9.2.7 below) 
  local health and safety    committees (see A/9.2.8 below).
