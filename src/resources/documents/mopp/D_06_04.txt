6.4.1 Policy  
Biosafety assurance at QUT relates  to protecting the health and safety of people and the environment by  identifying and minimising risks posed by University research, teaching or  other associated activities. Fundamentally, these risks fall into two broad  categories:
    transmission of infectious disease to staff, students  or the public as a result of QUT-related activities; and/or
    the accidental / unauthorised release of infectious  agents or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from their appropriate  levels of containment.
There are two principal compliance  regimes to which QUT must adhere in relation to these activities:
  Australian Standards for workplace health and safety  authorities - which specify work practices in laboratories that deal with  infectious agents; and
  the Office  of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) &ndash; which specifies and  participates in a regulatory regime for dealings with GMOs.
Activities involving the use of GMOs  and/or biosafety materials must be submitted for the appropriate level of  University review, and the applicant must receive notification of approval  before the project can be commenced.
QUT  Institute Biosafety Committee reviews and monitors the conduct of  activities involving the use of GMOs and/or biosafety materials, and ensures  compliance with requirements such as those of the State and Federal Gene Technology Regulations and the QUT Code of Conduct for Research.
Guidelines  to assist with applications relating to biosafety assurance are available on  the Research  Ethics website.&nbsp; The University&rsquo;s  policy on research ethics ( D/6.1 ) should also be consulted for general guidance on the conduct of&nbsp; projects.
Researchers  who are unclear of their obligations should consult the Research  Ethics website, their supervisor / research team and/or the Human Resources Department (Health and Safety Advisory Services).
