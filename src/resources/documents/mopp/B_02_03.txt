2.3.1 Associates of QUT 
Council wishes to acknowledge formally the academic contributions made to QUT by individuals who are
  not staff of the University. To this end, Associates of the Queensland University of Technology may
be appointed.
Associates are of high professional standing in the community. Their formal association with QUT enhances
  the University's academic program.
In assessing a candidate's suitability for appointment, consideration is given to evidence of:
substantial contribution having been made to QUT;
continuing active involvement with QUT;
potential to contribute significantly to QUT in the future.

2.3.2 Procedures for appointment 
Associates of QUT will be appointed by the Vice-Chancellor following advice from an executive dean
  of faculty. Each recommendation should be accompanied by a curriculum vitae. The Vice-Chancellor will
  advise Council of each appointment.
It is expected that, for each appointee, evidence will be advanced of contributions to QUT in at least
  two of the following areas:
significant contribution in teaching;
course development;
leading and promoting research and development projects in the Associate's area of competence;
offering expert advice.

2.3.3 Conditions of appointment 
An Associate of QUT is appointed for a period not exceeding three years. An application for renewal
  of appointment can be made by an executive dean of faculty to the Vice-Chancellor. In the absence of
  such an application, the appointment lapses.
Associates of QUT are appointed on such conditions as determined by Council. An Associate is responsible,
  in relation to activities involving the University, to the appropriate executive dean of faculty or
  head of school.
Associates must not be 
ex officio
members of any QUT board or committee. Associates are afforded
  access to QUT facilities considered appropriate to academic staff. Their names are added to the list
  of academic staff in the relevant faculty and school.
No remuneration attaches to the appointment.
