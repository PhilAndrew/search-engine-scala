Modification History 
Payroll tax is a State tax based on the annual payroll of employers. The legislation under which
  payroll tax operates is the 
Payroll Tax Act 1971.
The University's annual payroll exceeds
  the current exemption threshold of $1,000,000 and therefore falls within the compliance requirements
of the legislation.
Currently the payroll tax rate is 4.75%.
