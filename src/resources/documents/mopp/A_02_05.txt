2.5.1 Policy 
QUT is committed to establishing an organisational philosophy and culture  that ensures effective business risk management is an integral and embedded part  of all University activities and a core management capability. Risk management  allows the University to take advantage of opportunities to improve its  outcomes and outputs by ensuring that any risk taken is based on informed decision-making  and on realistic analysis of possible outcomes.
QUT is also committed to 
business  continuity management
as an integral component of risk  management, to ensure continuity of key business processes.
This policy does not intend to  eliminate risk completely, rather it sets a framework to manage effectively the  risks involved in all University activities.
Top 
2.5.2 Rationale 
QUT's  responsibility to establish and maintain an appropriate University-wide risk  management system stems from the Financial and Performance Management  Standard 2009 (Qld) which requires an agency to protect itself from  unacceptable costs or losses associated with its operations including, for  example, by developing and implementing systems for effectively managing the  risks that may affect the agency's operations. QUT addresses this  responsibility through implementation of a system for risk management based on  the International and Australian and New Zealand Standard for Risk Management (AS/NZS  31000:2009). Further, QUT acknowledges that risk management is an integral part  of good management practice and an essential element of good corporate  governance.
The  function of risk management is to provide a sound contribution to the  achievement of QUT's corporate objectives and to support the strategic  directions of divisions, faculties and institutes. This is demonstrated through  the integration and embedding of risk management within the following QUT  frameworks and plans:
  Governance Framework (A/1.1)
     Planning Framework (A/2.2)
     Risk       Management Framework
     Project Management       Framework
     Business Case Framework
     Corruption and Fraud Control       Plan

2.5.3 Definitions 
Risk is the effect of  uncertainty on the University's ability to contribute to its vision, goals and  organisational values.
Effect is a deviation from  the expected and can be either positive (opportunity) or negative.
Risk  management is the coordination of activities to direct and control QUT with regard to  risk, including the establishment of culture, policy, processes and structures.
Risk  management process is the systematic application of management policies, procedures and practices  to the activities of communicating, consulting, establishing the context, and  identifying, analysing, evaluating, treating, monitoring and reviewing risk.
Risk owner is a person or an  entity with the accountability and authority to manage a risk.

2.5.4 Principles of risk management 
Based  on the principles of risk management as per AS/NZS 31000:2009, QUT defines that,  in order to be effective, risk management should:
  create  and protect value
  be  an integral part of all University processes
  be  part of decision making
  explicitly  address uncertainty
  be  systematic, structured and timely
  be  based on the best available information
  be  tailored to suit the University&rsquo;s context
  take  human and cultural factors into account
  be  transparent and inclusive
  be  dynamic, iterative and responsive to change 
  facilitate  continual improvement of the University, and
  be  cost effective in that the costs associated with managing risks do not outweigh  the anticipated positive or negative consequences. 
Top 
2.5.5 Objectives 
The  objectives of this policy are to ensure:
  a common or consistent approach       to management of risk is adopted within QUT 
  the management of risk       contributes to the quality of performance and continuous improvement of       QUT business, its operations and delivery of services, and 
  all significant risks to QUT       are identified, evaluated, managed and reported in a timely manner to       Council through its Audit and Risk Management Committee. 
Top 
2.5.6 Roles and responsibilities 
The  Vice-Chancellor and senior managers are responsible for implementing the risk  management policy through a Risk Management Framework and for ensuring that  adequate resources are available to enable the effective management of risk  within the University.
Managers  at all levels are accountable for the identification and effective management of  risk within their areas of responsibility.

2.5.7 QUT Risk Management Framework
