5.2.1 Purpose of awards 
The purpose of the QUT Outstanding Alumni Awards is to recognise graduates  of QUT and its predecessor institutions for exceptional professional, academic  or research achievement and contribution to the community at the local, state,  national or international levels. The awards are offered annually as an  initiative of Alumni Board. 
Top 
5.2.2 Structure of awards 
The following Outstanding Alumni Awards are offered on  an annual basis:
  Chancellor's Outstanding Alumnus (one award)
  Faculty awards (one per faculty)
  QUT Outstanding Young Alumnus (one award)
  Special excellence awardsTop 
5.2.3 Eligibility for nominations 
Australian and overseas graduates (alumni) of QUT and its predecessor institutions are eligible candidates for the QUT Outstanding Alumni Awards.
Nominated alumni should have displayed an ongoing high level of achievement  in their field and in service to the community and are most likely to have a  minimum of 10 years of career experience. The faculty awards are not designed  to recognise those who are nearing graduation or who have recently graduated. The  exception to this is the QUT Outstanding Young &nbsp;Alumnus Award which is designed to recognise  those who are up to 35 years at the time of nomination.
To be eligible for nomination, alumni do not have to be working in the  particular discipline from which they graduated. Previously nominated alumni  who were unsuccessful in winning an award may be re-nominated by attaching  up-to-date information to the nomination form. 
Top 
5.2.4 Selection process 
Nominations for the awards may be submitted by both members of the  University community and the wider community.
Special excellence awards may be made at the discretion of the Chancellor's  Judging Panel.
Details of the selection process for the QUT Outstanding Alumni Awards are  available from the Alumni web page ( http://www.alumni.qut.edu.au/ ).
