9.5.1 First aid obligations 
Under the Workplace Health and Safety  Act 1995 (Qld), QUT has a responsibility to provide staff and students with  access to first aid facilities that are in accordance with the First Aid Code of Practice  2004.To  meet this obligation, QUT requires all managers to undertake a risk assessment  of their first aid requirements taking into account first  aid personnel, first aid equipment, infection control, training and record  keeping.
Details of first aid requirements are outlined on  the Workplace  Health and Safety Queensland website.

9.5.2 First aid resources
Each organisational area shall determine its own needs for first aid resources  in accordance with the First Aid Code of Practice  2004. Managers will determine, based on risk assessment, the number of first  aid officers (both designated and voluntary ), the need for immunisation  related to potential biological hazards and infection control requirements (eg  Hepatitis B), training or re-training needs, and the number and type of first  aid kits required for their area. Related costs are to be met from the  organisational area's budget.
A designated first aid officer must be assigned to manage, inspect and  update each first aid kit. First aid kits must have a content checklist and  appropriate signage, and are to be reviewed periodically to ensure 'in date' and completeness of contents.
Further information is available on the HR Health  and Safety Advisory Services website.

9.5.3 First aid officers 
First aid officers are appointed within each organisational area (A/9.2).
The names and locations of current first aid officers, both designated and  voluntary, are to be displayed in prominent positions in the relevant areas of  the University.
Further information on first aid officers and voluntary health and safety  roles is available on the Human Resources website.

off-campus (eg on field trips), medical assistance should be

9.5.7 Ambulance assistance 
If an ambulance is needed for a serious injury or medical emergency, quickly  check the situation for danger and assess the person's condition. Consider the  wishes of the person if they are conscious and coherent. If the situation is  assessed as life threatening, or there is any doubt, then dial 000 (after  obtaining an outside line where necessary) and follow the instructions of  Queensland Ambulance. Ask nearby persons for suitable assistance and, when  able, call the QUT 24 hour Emergency Security Number (Ext 88888 or 3138 8888) to request immediate security  assistance. Briefly explain the circumstances and location to the Security  Officer who will initiate appropriate procedures including provision of advice  to Queensland Ambulance on campus location and best route of access.
