1.6.1 Electronic portfolio 
QUT is  committed to supporting student connectedness with University experience after  graduation and promotes the use of the electronic portfolio to assist in  learning and teaching, preparation for employment and in the development of  graduate capabilities. The electronic portfolio forms an important component of learning at  QUT and offers the prospect of greater retention of learning after graduation.  The electronic portfolio is available to students throughout their period of  enrolment, and upon graduation as alumni. The portfolio data may be filed on centrally  provided storage.

1.6.2 Digital storage of electronic portfolio data 
As part of its overall information technology strategy, the University provides
each student with digital storage in accordance with the following conditions.
Electronic portfolio material is stored and accessible indefinitely
  after graduation, subject to normal availability and business continuity of
  the University's information technology systems. The storage quota is determined
  annually by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Technology, Information and Learning
  Support).
The University may make copies of the electronic portfolio material
  in a fixed medium from time to time upon request.
QUT graduates and alumni are considered to be 
users
