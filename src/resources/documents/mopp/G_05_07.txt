5.7.1 Policy 
Corporate membership of professional bodies will be paid for by the University. Corporate membership
  means that either QUT is the member or that QUT has nominated a staff member to serve on the University's
behalf.
The cost of individual membership of professional bodies must be met by the individual staff member,
  and may not be paid for from University operating funds (see section 
B/12.5
However, individual members of staff who have consultancy funds available may seek the approval of
  their executive dean of faculty / head of division through the appropriate head of school / department
  / section to pay membership fees from their surplus fund. Approval is based on the relevance of the
  membership to
the goals of the University
the official duties of the staff member
the availability of surplus funds for the staff member.
