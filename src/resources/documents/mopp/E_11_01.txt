11.1.1 Description 
Prizes and awards may be in the form of a cheque, equipment, book voucher or 
  subscriptions to professional organisations.
The minimum value of new externally funded undergraduate prizes and awards 
  across all faculties is normally $500.
Top 
11.1.2 Procedure 
Prizes and awards are normally presented to students who demonstrate outstanding 
  academic achievement in a nominated subject or course. Other appropriate criteria 
  may be negotiated where appropriate.
QUT normally seeks a minimum commitment from the donor for a period of no less 
  than three years, reviewable annually. QUT requires a signed letter from the 
  donor detailing the criteria of the prize or award and confirming the donor's 
  commitment to offering the prize or award for a specified period of time. A 
  copy of this letter should be filed in the QUT Alumni and Development Office.
Faculties may organise their own presentation ceremonies to present prizes 
  and awards to students. A representative of the organisation will usually be 
  invited to present the prize or award to the student. Donors may also choose 
  to award the student at their own function.
Top 
11.1.3 Donor recognition 
Donors are recognised when students are presented with their prize or award 
  at faculty ceremonies. Prizes and awards are also listed on faculty websites 
  and in relevant QUT and faculty publications. Details of prizes and awards (and 
  their donors) received by a student are usually included in their academic record.
Top 
11.1.4 Roles and responsibilities 
Individual faculties are responsible for the soliciting of prizes and awards 
  and approaches to potential donors. The Alumni and Development Office coordinates all solicitation 
  of prizes and awards and must be consulted before the establishment of any new 
  prizes and awards.
Prizes and awards are administered by the faculties and the faculties are responsible 
  for coordinating payment to recipients. The Alumni and Development Office is responsible 
  for invoicing and receipting donors each year.
