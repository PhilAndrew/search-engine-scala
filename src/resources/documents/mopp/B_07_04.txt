Modification History 
7.4.1 Leave entitlements 
Prior service with the University on a fixed-term basis will be recognised 
  for the purpose of accruing all leave entitlements provided there is no break 
  in service.
Any prior service with the University will be recognised towards the staff 
  member's accumulation of long service leave entitlements provided the break 
  in service does not exceed three months. In this instance, any accrued sick 
  leave entitlement will also be recognised.
In the case of service completed as a sessional staff member, service with breaks exceeding three months will also be recognised where it is a result of a break between consecutive semesters.

7.4.2 Incremental Step 
Prior service will be taken into account with regard to the increment step 
  of the salary scale to which the staff member is appointed provided the break 
  in service does not exceed three months.
