Modification History
Teaching and learning activities at QUT occur largely within the context of a set of courses which range in level from bachelor to doctoral, and at higher levels can be either coursework or research.
Each of the levels in the course profile (ie from bachelor to doctoral) will
  conform to the guidelines, including learning outcome characteristics and pathways
  as described in the Australian Qualifications Framework Implementation Handbook.
  Access to QUT's courses is via a range of articulation mechanisms which recognise
  the diverse learning experiences of applicants. QUT's course provision strategy  has more details of the nature of courses and of the linkages.
The pedagogy incorporates a number of characteristics including the following
Student-centredness
A principal aim is to facilitate student learning
Teaching approaches are student-centred and are characterised by flexibility in delivery and innovation
QUT has a particular aim for students' first       year experience (C/6.2).
Curriculum design
The learning is founded on curriculum which incorporates clearly stated student learning outcomes
The curriculum design is integrated and links learning outcomes with the rationale and aims, the teaching approaches, assessment and resources
In particular, assessment (C/5.1) is regarded as a valuable tool for facilitating learning
The learning outcomes include graduate capabilities (C/4.3).
Learning environments
The learning environment uses blended learning approaches to maximise student learning
  through technologically enhanced contexts
  The learning environment is as authentic as possible (ie modelled on real world applications) and, in particular, workplace experience is incorporated where possible in curriculum design
The learning environments take into account the diverse range of student backgrounds and approaches.
Teachers
QUT's policy for High quality teaching (C/7.1) guides the effective development of practice in teaching
In particular, scholarly teaching and scholarship of teaching are valued, encouraged and supported through QUT's policy for High quality teaching
Notwithstanding that QUT regards itself as a campus-based University, teaching approaches will explore the use of technology and on-line learning experiences as appropriate to the discipline and circumstance.
These principles are incorporated in various aspects of policy. In addition to the references above, a principal policy on curriculum design at the unit level is the unit outline proforma (C/4.5 and Learning and Teaching Unit website).
