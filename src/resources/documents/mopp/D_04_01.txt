4.1.1 Description 
Institutes are formed as University-level entities in response to their potential to contribute to
  the University's strategic plans for research, and to achieve research outcomes that cannot be achieved
  by faculties operating alone. They draw on the research strengths of faculties while fostering synergies
  and collaboration on a larger scale within the University, and contribute to the University's research
capacity building through attraction of high level research staff.
Institutes will contribute to the evolution of research management structures at QUT particularly
  in their impact on existing arrangements in participating faculties, including the functioning of faculty
  research centres. An interdependent partnership model will characterise the relationship between institutes
  and participating faculties. This interdependence will normally be evident in resourcing flows, budget
  and staff management and accountability for enhanced research outcomes.
Institutes will be characterised by:
strategic fit with QUT's research strengths;
responsiveness to national and state research priorities;
alignment with regional, and industry specific economic development priorities;
novel interdisciplinary research and depth of disciplinary expertise; and
ability to harness global economic opportunities and project QUT's research impact
    internationally.
Institutes undertake research and research training, as well as the dissemination of research through
  outside work such as commercial research, consultancy and community engagement. Consultancy and continuing
  professional education activities undertaken by institutes must be value-adding and novel by virtue
of their interdisciplinary nature.
Top 
4.1.2 Definitions 
“member of an institute”
refers to institute staff, and academic and professional staff employed by the University and located
  in the faculties and divisions as determined by the institute director following recommendation of
  the executive dean of faculty or head of division and agreement concerning the share of a member's
  research which is assigned to the institute; the institute director or nominee will have a formal role
  in the faculty-based or division-based performance planning and review process for members of the institute.
Top 
4.1.3 Formation of an institute 
Proposals to form institutes should be discussed at an early stage with the Deputy Vice-Chancellor
  (Research and Commercialisation). Following wide consultation across the University and approval to
  present a formal case for establishment of an institute, the proposal will be assessed by University
  Research and Innovation Committee for recommendation to University Academic Board, which recommends
to Council.
Those proposing formation of an institute must prepare a proposal including the information required
  by the Institute Application Proforma, and a business plan consistent with the QUT 
Business
  Case Framework
Applications and business plans should focus on:
alignment with the institute characteristics listed in D/4.1.1. above, and with QUT's
      research aspirations articulated in the institutional plans;
the research and development strategy, and measures designed to ensure its successful
      implementation;
relevant quality measures;
costs and benefits to QUT, and how risks will be managed;
opportunities for wide-ranging participation by QUT faculties and staff;
governance and management arrangements, including financial management, and relationship
      management within QUT;
organisational reporting requirements.
In assessing proposals to form an institute, University Research and Innovation Committee may seek
  independent external review of proposals.
Top 
4.1.4 Selection criteria 
Proposals to form institutes will be assessed on merit according to the following guidelines:
(i) Strategic purpose / objectives
the ability of the institute to accelerate university research, commercial research and research
    training priorities;
the ability of the institute to contribute to state and national research priorities;
the ability of the institute to become a national leader, and recognised international
      contributor in a defined area of research strength;
the ability of the institute to accelerate cross-faculty collaboration;
the ability of the institute to contribute to professional staff and academic staff
    career development in research areas;
(ii) Structure
the director's capacity for leadership, vision, management and strategic planning;
integration and management of the relationship with stakeholding faculties, including
      any impacts on the structure and / or operations of faculty research centres;
(iii) Research training
the contribution of the institute to research training at the honours, postgraduate
    and early career researcher level;
the extent to which research training activities align with the institute's research
      focus and strategic objectives;
(iv) Outputs
the quality of the existing and potential research;
the proposed institute's existing and projected contribution to QUT's earnings for
    Institutional Grants Scheme, Research Training Scheme and Research Infrastructure Block Grant;
the impact of research outputs across standard performance indicators (grants, publications,
      and completions) in relation to national and international competitors;
the potential for the institute to develop and promote a commercialisation culture
    that supports intellectual property protection and facilitates technology transfer;
the ability of the institute to develop verifiable public good outcomes;
(v) International, national and regional links and networks
the standing of the institute relative to major international centres in the field;
the potential for development and enhancement of international interactions, linkages
      and funding;
(vi) End-user links
relevance of the proposed program of research to potential end-users;
potential to attract external partners to the institute and develop long-term strategic
      partnerships;
the potential opportunity to deliver education and outreach programs in professional
      and technical training;
(vii) Indicative measures - within the above guidelines, the following measures would normally be
  expected as indicative of the minimum size, scope and capacity of an institute:
a critical mass of 30 individual 
active
      researchers
proposed as members
    of the institute contributing to the research objectives of the institute;
50 PhD and masters by research students, with an average of 15 to 20 completions per
      annum;
existing and projected contribution to QUT's earnings for Institutional Grants Scheme,
      Research Training Scheme and Research Infrastructure Block Grant equivalent to 10% of the University's
      total earnings allocated under these schemes;
annual budget (all sources) of $3 million.
Top 
4.1.5 Funding 
The operational funding base of the institute must be designed so as to ensure its capacity to significantly
  accelerate the research productivity of QUT and to increase QUT's external research funding base and
  its share of the nationally available Research Block Funding pool. Institutes will normally receive
  seed funding from the University Research Budget, the participating faculties and a share of Commonwealth
  Block Funding for research according to the productivity of its members, and the location of costs.
Research infrastructure funds will be split between institutes and faculties on an agreed basis and
  implemented by Finance and Resource Planning using a transparent institute-specific formula-driven
  model. It is anticipated that the formula will be different for capital-intensive institutes or more
  virtual institutes. Faculties have a range of support and research costs associated with research infrastructure
  which may (and in the case of capital intensive institutes, will) be managed and funded by institutes
  to reflect the split of research infrastructures funds between faculties and institutes.
These sources provide the operational base for the institute. The proportion of this funding base
  which is performance-driven will increase during the life of the institute.
The duration and amount of University Research Budget seed funding will be determined by the Deputy
  Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation) in consultation with the Vice-Chancellor and Executive
  Director, Finance and Resource Planning.
It is expected that external sources of funding (including project grants won by institute members,
  sponsorships, commercial and other income) will provide at least a 3:1 leveraging of internal funds
  (University Research Budget and faculty grants to the institute for operating purposes). A priority
  for institutes is winning international competitive research funds.
Top 
4.1.6 Powers 
As institutes are a component of the University, all human resource, financial, commercial, facilities
  and other arrangements, and all academic programs, are made in accordance with University policy and
  procedures.
Reporting to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation), an
    institute director is responsible for the achievement of the agreed objectives of the institute.
Top 
4.1.7 Structures 
Each institute shall have governance, management and advisory committee structures as approved by
  the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation). As faculties are major investors in institutes,
  executive deans would be expected to have a significant role in the governance of an institute. Research
  domain / program leaders, heads of school, research staff and students and external representatives
  would be expected to have a role in these structures.
Institutes are managed by a director who is responsible to the Vice-Chancellor through the Deputy
  Vice-Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation). Details of the appointment, and review, of institute
  directors are detailed in 
D/4.5
Top 
4.1.8 Planning and reporting 
Institutes comply with the University planning, budgeting and annual reporting processes ( see 
A/2.2
), based on three year plans and annual reports. Risk
      management and business continuity are also addressed in accordance with University processes (
      see 
A/2.5
An annual report proforma is available from the 
Office of Research
web page.
Top 
4.1.9 Review 
Institutes will be reviewed in accordance with Corporate Reviews processes ( see 
A/2.3
), based on five year external reviews, with the particular emphases
identified below.

                          Research Council;
editorships;
a major role in successfully completed research projects including leadership
                        of research teams;
a history of successful competitive research grants received and research successfully
                          carried out;
leadership of research teams;
the extent to which the institute has contributed to a coherent commercialisation culture across
      the institute and the broader University that supports intellectual property protection and facilitates
    technology transfer.
Top 
4.1.10 Closure 
The decision to wind up an institute may follow a review, or be at some other time judged appropriate
  by the University. The monitoring of an institute's performance, and its continuing fit with QUT's
  strategic plans, is done within the framework of the University's management processes. An institute
  may be wound up when the purpose for which it was established has been fulfilled, or is no longer a
  strategic priority for the University, or the institute no longer meets the criteria for institutes
  detailed in 
D/4.1.4
A recommendation for closure of an institute will be considered by University Research and Innovation
  Committee for recommendation to University Academic Board, which recommends to Council.
