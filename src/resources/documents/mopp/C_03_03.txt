3.3.1 Policy 
QUT offers non-award  courses and studies which provide the wider community with an opportunity to  undertake a sequence of University units to further levels of knowledge and  skills in particular areas and to enhance employment opportunities.
Top 3.3.2 Non-award courses 
Non-award courses  comprise approved QUT award units, but the course does not lead to a University  award. Non-award courses may include certificates, diplomas, bridging programs  and foundation programs, and may be run as University-wide courses,  faculty-based courses or through the QUT   International College. Faculties may choose to provide certificates  to students on completion of the course.  Entry to non-award courses is available to all participants meeting the  specified entry requirements for the course.
Non-award courses are normally approved at  the faculty level. University-wide  courses may require University level approval.

3.3.3 Non-award studies 
Students  may undertake non-award studies by enrolling in certain award units without  being admitted to an award course.  Requirements for enrolment in award units as a non-award student are  provided in E/4.1.10.
