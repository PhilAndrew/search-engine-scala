Modification History 
3.1.1 Policy principles 
International Cooperation Agreements are one form of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This
  policy is intended to ensure that the University's formal international engagements accord with
  the University's international vision and strategic objectives, and its policy on management
  of contracts and MOUs (
G/6.1
). It provides
  a framework for the development, maintenance and management of all international agreements and memoranda
of understanding.
All agreements between the University and international partner institutions require approval of the
  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International and Development) following an assessment and  recommendation by the Director, International Business Development, QUT  International.
Further guidelines for the administration and maintenance of International Cooperation Agreements
  can be found at:
  www.isis.qut.edu.au/toolkit/polframe/coop-agree.jsp.

3.1.2 Scope 
This policy applies to all International Cooperation Agreements which, in any way, commit University
resources, with the following exceptions:
commercial or contractual agreements that are negotiated through the Division of Research and Commercialisation,
    including transnational teaching arrangements, and
QUT International Recruitment Representative Contracts and Agreements (see 
I/3.2
Top 
3.1.3 Approval process 
QUT staff who identify the need for the establishment of a formal agreement or memorandum with an
  international institution should in the first instance liaise with the relevant faculty or divisional
  committee for consideration and endorsement by the executive dean of faculty or head of division. The
proposal should include an explicit statement that:
provides the rationale for the agreement;
identifies the contact person/s and their functions in the institution;
provides an indication of how the outcomes of the agreement may be managed;
includes a time horizon for the agreement and necessary review dates;
identifies obligations for both parties; and
considers any issues which may be pertinent to QUT's broader engagement in a specific country
    / region (eg home country financial aid arrangements).
Following  formal endorsement by the executive dean of faculty or head of division, the  proposal is forwarded to the Director, International Business Development, QUT  International, for comment and recommendation to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor  (International and Development) via the Executive Director, QUT International.  The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International and Development) reports annually to  the Vice-Chancellor on approved agreements.

3.1.4  Review 
Agreements will normally be  made for a three year period, with a review to be conducted six months prior to  expiry. Where agreements involve student exchange, QUT will provide an  indication of the balance of inbound and outbound students to assist in the  review.
