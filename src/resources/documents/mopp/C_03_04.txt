3.4.1 Policy 
As part of its strategy to  strengthen engagement with business, industry, government, professional and  international communities, QUT offers a range of customised education  activities designed to meet the needs of specific cohorts of students who may  be employees of, or provided by, an external organisation, or to meet  the identified needs of target groups within the general community. For the purposes of this policy, an external  organisation can be either a single employer, or an industry group representing  a number of employers.
Customised education activities fall into three categories:
  Corporate award courses - University award courses (see C/3.1 ) which are not open to general admission, but are offered to employees       of, or students provided by, an external organisation with whom a contract is in place
  Corporate professional development programs - continuing professional education programs which  are developed specifically for an external organisation with whom a       contract is in place, and are offered to employees of, or students provided by, the external organisation. These programs do not lead to a recognised award and the content does not comprise award units (but they may  be used to provide advanced standing into an award course)
  Open continuing professional education  programs &ndash; continuing professional education programs including conferences  which are designed to meet identified needs of target groups within the  professional or general community, and are open to all interested participants.  These programs do not lead to a recognised award and the content does not  comprise award units (but they may be used to provide advanced standing into an  award course).
 Customised courses and programs may be  offered onshore or offshore.
Corporate  award courses are subject to the same approval and quality assurance  requirements as University award courses (see C/4.1 ). Continuing professional education programs are approved in accordance with the Schedule of Authorities and Delegations. Where a professional education program is to  be used as advanced standing into a QUT award course, approval and quality  assurance processes ensure that the continuing professional education program  satisfies the learning outcomes of the relevant unit or units in the award  course (see C/3.1 ).
Staff  involved in continuing professional education programs are subject to the  conditions of the University outside work policy (see D/7.1). The Office  of Commercial Services provides guidance on assessing and managing customised  education proposals and must be involved in any continuing professional  education programs which meet the criteria outlined for outside work  activities (see D/7.1.16).
As individual courses or  programs are likely to have some unique features due to the different needs of  the external organisation, all customised education activities must be  developed and maintained under a governance structure.

3.4.2 Strategy for customised  education 
All  customised education activities will satisfy the following key criteria:
  the  customised education activity will conform with QUT's and the proposing faculty/ies  strategic plan
  the  customised education activity normally should not require additional off-campus  space. Where facilities are needed by way of lease or purchase, the Vice-Chancellor's  approval is required
  customised  education activities must be based on a robust business case,  that demonstrates financial sustainability in  accordance with the University's Business Case  Framework . The activity will only be undertaken where it can be  demonstrated that there is
      a  strategic return for the University which might include the  positioning of the University (through a faculty or faculties) in major  academic disciplines or professions, or the development of strategic relations  with major clients, and/or
      a   financial return to the University which can be used to fund  additional core business activities in the faculty or University
  the  customised education activity must be within QUT's current discipline and  professional areas of expertise unless there is a clear documented planned  strategy to offer an activity outside current discipline areas
  the  customised education activity must be supported by the professional and  teaching expertise currently within the University, unless there is a strategic  reason to do otherwise. Where activities  are run using expertise hired from outside the University, there must be a  strategy for leveraging the contributions of those staff, in addition to any  direct involvement in the activity that they may have. For example, staff of the external  organisation may be involved in refreshing the standard award course curriculum  of the participating faculty or faculties, or be engaged in research projects  arising from the relationship between the University and partner or client  organisation/s
  where an  external organisation is involved, it must be highly reputable and corporate social  responsibility issues should be considered.  Due diligence will be conducted in each case as part of the business  case, and will include a credit risk check of the external organisation by the  Division of Finance and Resource Planning.

3.4.3 Governance of customised  education activities 
Faculties are expected to establish a governance  structure to oversee the development, approval and ongoing quality assurance of  all customised education activities within the faculty. Faculties may choose to  establish the governance structure either as a separate governance group or  groups and/or to establish a structure that uses existing faculty committees  (normally a faculty executive group for executive matters and the faculty  academic board for academic governance). 
The governance structure established  by the faculty should allocate clear responsibilities for approving continuing  professional education courses and ensuring that, where appropriate, the  following documentation and processes are developed and approved in accordance  with University policy:
  a  project management framework 
  business case
  relevant  agreement or contract (see G/6.1)
  course  approval documentation (see C/4.1)
  ongoing  quality assurance
  post-implementation  review.
Governance groups are not involved in management of the  customised education activities. Guidelines for establishing faculty governance  structures for customised education, including the typical membership of a  governance group are available on the Learning and Teaching Unit website. 
Top 
3.4.4 Role of divisional service  providers 
Divisional support for customised education activities  will be negotiated on a fully costed fee-for-service basis. Specific examples include:
  The Office of Commercial Services will provide business services and advice on contracts / agreements, and may manage customised education activities 
  The Division of Administrative Services will provide services and advice relating to administrative support 
  The Division of Technology, Information and Learning Support will provide services and advice relating to information technology, library, printing and learning and teaching 
  Audit and Risk Management Services will provide services for audit and quality assurance 
  The Office of Research will provide services and advice relating to research matters.
