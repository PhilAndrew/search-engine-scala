Terms of reference
Audit and Risk Management Committee advises both Council and the Vice-Chancellor as accountable officer
  on the performance or discharge of functions and duties under the 
Financial Accountability Act 2009, the 
Financial and Performance Management Standard 2009
and the University's Assurance and Risk Management Services Charter (
A/1.5
Audit and Risk Management Committee's main functions are to:
assess and contribute to the audit process including evaluation and facilitation of the internal
    audit function;
oversee and approve financial and operational reporting;
assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the University&rsquo;s internal controls, including the risk management and compliance frameworks.
Specifically Audit and Risk Management Committee will undertake the following:
Internal Audit
Audit and Risk Management Committee:
approves the University's Assurance and Risk Management Services Charter ;
considers the development and implementation of systems and procedures to ensure the internal audit
    function operates efficiently, effectively and is consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors
    - Australian Standards;
reviews and approves
the Assurance and Risk Management Services strategic audit plan;
on delegated authority of Council, the annual internal audit plan and work program;
reports on the internal audit function in each annual report and participates in any review of
    the effectiveness of the internal audit function including the appointment and termination of the
    Director, Assurance and Risk Management Services;
considers the way in which the internal audit function may be performed either by employees of
    the University or by external consultants or by a combination of both;
considers all audit reports by the internal audit function, and quarterly activity reports, and
    documents the consideration, action required and officers to whom the action is assigned and ensures
    follow-up action is performed by reviewing the outcome, directions or recommendations made;

External Audit
Audit and Risk Management Committee:
monitors the authorised auditors including:
consideration of the proposed external audit strategy, timeframe and fees for the year;
review of the recommendations and comments in their reports;
consideration of the relationship between the internal audit function, to ensure appropriate
      consultation to minimise unnecessary duplication of audit work and promote economy of audit activities.
Risk
Audit and Risk Management Committee:
evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the University's risk management and compliance frameworks
    through quarterly reporting and advises Council on:
QUT's exposure to and management of significant business risks;
the management reporting and control systems used to monitor adherence to compliance with legislative
      requirements, contractual arrangements and QUT policy and procedures;
QUT's business continuity plans;
QUT's exposure to risks in relation to corruption and fraud;
considers and monitors the standard of ethical conduct in areas such as conflict of interest.
General
Audit and Risk Management Committee:

    the Vice-Chancellor or internal audit function.
Membership
Chancellor or external Council member nominated by the Chancellor
Four external members with professional accounting, financial or auditing expertise nominated
    from or by Council (where an external member of Council has such expertise the appointment should
    be from Council, otherwise appointment of an external non-Council member with such expertise should
    be made by Council)
The Chair shall be nominated by the Chancellor from the other three members of the Committee.
A nominee of the Registrar is secretary.
The Vice-Chancellor, the Executive Director, Finance and Resource Planning, the Director, Assurance and Risk Management Services, and such other persons as determined by Audit and Risk Management Committee, shall have rights
  of audience and debate only.
Relationships
The internal audit function is part of both the Vice-Chancellor's and Council's accountability mechanisms
  (see 
Assurance and Risk Management Services Charter
). The internal audit
  function reports to Audit and Risk Management Committee of Council to ensure the governing body's designated
  committee receives advice on significant audit issues. The Committee then ensures Council is advised
  by reporting on a regular basis.
The Committee will meet at least annually and alone with each of the stakeholders, including internal
  audit, external audit and management.
Tenure and frequency of meeting
Terms of office are detailed in section 6 of 
Council
      Procedure 1 - Committees
Audit and Risk Management Committee normally meets in the cycle of meetings leading up to Council
  meetings, with an additional meeting in February to consider draft financial statements.
Reporting
Following each meeting, Audit and Risk Management Committee reports to the next meeting of Council.
