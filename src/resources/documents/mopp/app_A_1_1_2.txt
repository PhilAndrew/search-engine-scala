[Print-friendly version]
The 
external obligations 
set down in legislation which the University must meet are contained in the top half of the hour glass. External influences, such as political agendas, "best practice" corporate guidelines, professional standards and community expectations must also be included when considering the University's external obligations. 
Council is the driver or fulcrum in the centre of the hour glass, bringing influence to bear in both the external and internal environments. 
The role of Council
is to direct and control action within the University, ultimately reporting back to the external bodies to which it is accountable. 
Council and management establish the 
internal programs, policies and processes 
through which the University discharges its obligations and undertakes its activities, as illustrated in the bottom half of the hour glass.
