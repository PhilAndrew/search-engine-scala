Modification History 
9.7.1 Policy on smoking 
Given the proven health risks of  smoking, QUT is moving towards making the University a smoke-free environment.
 Smoking is prohibited : 
  in all buildings or parts of buildings under  QUT's control 
  in any outdoor area of a food outlet, or any  outdoor area where food and drink is provided
  in QUT vehicles 
  within 10 metres of any entrance to buildings, air conditioning intakes, ventilation louvres or opened windows 
  on all semi-enclosed thoroughfares such as  verandahs or colonnades and on all elevated walkways with or without fixed  roof structures which require people using building entrances or moving  between buildings to pass through tobacco smoke emissions 
  in any other area    where there is signage expressly prohibiting smoking. 
Smokers are required to follow  directions given by authorised QUT staff and Security personnel in regard to  the implementation and enforcement of the University's policy on smoking.
