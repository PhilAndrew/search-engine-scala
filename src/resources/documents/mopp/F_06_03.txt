Modification History
6.3.1 Legislative obligations 
The Right to Information Act 2009 (RTI  Act) and the Information Privacy Act 2009 place an obligation on QUT, as a public authority, to give a right of access to  information, including personal information, in the University's possession or  under its control.
These  acts also encourage the University to provide access to information through  administrative schemes wherever possible (F/6.3.8).
Top 
6.3.2 Policy principles 
QUT is committed to providing, as far as  practicable, an open environment which enables members of the public and the  QUT community to access information without recourse to formal procedures. The  University has a Publication Scheme which provides detailed information on its functions and activities.
It is recognised, however, that there will be  occasions when it is necessary or appropriate for an application to be made under  the RTI Act or Information Privacy Act, for instance, where third party or  sensitive information is requested, or where there are grounds for considering  that the information may be exempt from access.
Top 
6.3.3 Roles and responsibilities  
Vice-Chancellor
For the purposes of the RTI Act and  Information Privacy Act, the Vice-Chancellor, as the chief executive officer of  the University, is the 'principal officer', and as such, is the person  responsible for QUT's obligations under these acts. The Vice-Chancellor has formally  delegated responsibilities to other University staff for the processing and  review of access applications (Appendix 3).
Registrar
The Registrar, as delegated review officer,  is responsible for conducting formal, internal reviews of access decisions made  by the decision maker, if requested by an applicant or third party.
Decision  maker
The  Right to Information Officer (RTI Officer) has delegated responsibility from  the Vice-Chancellor for making initial decisions on applications for access to information  within the time periods stipulated in the RTI Act.
The Privacy Officer has  delegated responsibility from the Vice-Chancellor for making initial decisions  on applications for access to personal information within the time periods  stipulated in the Information Privacy Act. 
Heads of  organisational units
Heads of organisational units are responsible  for establishing procedures to locate information held in their areas, and for  certifying that all information relevant to the application has been located  upon request. In the event that information cannot be located, a written  statement must be provided to the decision maker indicating that the  information cannot be located, and outlining reasonable steps that have been  taken to locate the information.
Heads of organisational units are also responsible for  ensuring that administrative practices in their work area are consistent with  QUT's obligations under the RTI Act and Information Privacy Act, and should  liaise with the relevant decision maker to develop appropriate procedures where  necessary.
Top 
6.3.4 Applying for access to information 
Applications under the RTI Act or Information  Privacy Act must be made on the approved form and accompanied by any stipulated application fee.  Details on the application process and the University's procedures are  available at the University's access to information website. 
Top 
6.3.5 Charging for access to information  
Where applications under the RTI Act are  made, the fees and charges specified in the Act will be applied by the  University. In addition, hourly charges, for time spent searching for documents  and processing the application are payable. For RTI applications, access  charges (for instance, for photocopying and for time spent supervising  inspection of documents) are also imposed, and the University may recover its  costs for giving access in another form (eg viewing or obtaining a copy of a  video). However, where the total time spent on an application is less than five  hours, hourly charges are waived.
An applicant making an RTI application will  receive a charges estimate notice and may consult with the decision maker on  options for reducing the cost of the application. 
There are no application fees  or processing charges for applications requesting access to an individual&rsquo;s own  personal information under the Information Privacy Act. However, access charges  may be imposed, and the University may recover its costs for giving access in  another form. 
In very limited  circumstances, access charges may be waived on the grounds of financial  hardship.
Top 
6.3.6 Review and appeal of decisions 
The decision maker must provide to the  applicant reasons for decisions not to release information or to give only  partial access to information. Such decisions may be internally reviewed by the  University's review officer. Independent review by the Queensland Information  Commissioner is also available.
Top 
6.3.7 Confidentiality 
Under the RTI Act and Information Privacy Act,  the decision maker has a duty to assist an applicant to make an application  which is compliant with the requirements of these acts. The decision maker is  authorised to enter into a confidential relationship with an applicant or  prospective applicant and will not be required to reveal the identity of an  applicant to another University officer without the express agreement of the  applicant.
Top 
6.3.8 Administrative access to information 
The University has a number of administrative  access schemes which may allow individuals to access information  without formal application under the RTI Act or Information Privacy Act.
