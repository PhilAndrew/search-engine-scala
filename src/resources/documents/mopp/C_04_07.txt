    THIS POLICY IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW - CONTACT THE HEAD OF THE LEARNING AND TEACHING UNIT FOR FURTHER DETAILS .
4.7.1 Principles 
QUT is committed to the achievement of outstanding learning environments and  programs that lead to excellent outcomes for graduates based on effective  learning and teaching informed by the following principles: 
  input and  feedback from key stakeholders
  the need to  involve and empower all staff and students 
  systematic  evaluation and use of qualitative and quantitative feedback as a basis for  identifying, prioritising and reporting on improvement opportunities and  outcomes 
  universal  student evaluation of courses, units, teaching and student experience 
  performance  planning and review for academic staff. 
This policy describes the approach to the evaluation of units, teaching and  student experience including the current University approved student evaluation  surveys. The policy also sets out the roles and responsibilities of key  stakeholders in evaluation processes. This policy should be read in conjunction  with MOPP B/9.7  Evaluating Teaching Quality.

4.7.2 Evaluation of courses, units, teaching and  student experience 
Evaluation feedback can be collected using a range of methods including  University approved student evaluation surveys and other supplementary, but not substituted, methods  of evaluation (eg customised surveys, focus groups, peer review, moderation of  student learning outcomes with tutors).
University approved evaluation instruments are approved jointly by the  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Technology,  Information and Learning Support).
The current University approved evaluation surveys are as follows: 
  The Learning Experience Survey (LEX) 
  Universal student evaluation of teaching, learning and  units occurs via the Learning Experience Survey (LEX), administered each teaching  period for all units offered and the associated QUT staff who are identified as  teachers in the units. (Executive deans may, in special circumstances,  exempt individual teachers from the evaluation process, for example an invited  guest speaker giving a lecture or lectures, or a practitioner in an off-campus  clinical setting.) 
  Course and student experience surveys 
  Cyclical evaluations of courses and student experience  will be conducted via three related instruments - the First Year Experience  Survey (FYES), the Mid Year Experience Survey (MYES) and the Exit Year  Experience Survey (EYES). Each of these surveys is administered once every  three years within a three-year cycle.
  TellQUT 
  Ongoing gathering of student feedback about their  experience of learning and other experiences at QUT will occur via the  universal instrument "TellQUT", an online option open to students throughout  the semester. This instrument allows students to provide open-ended comments on  issues they consider of significance.
Results  of the evaluations of a unit are provided to the unit coordinator, their  supervisor, relevant course coordinators, the head of school and the executive  dean of faculty, and other University and faculty managers as appropriate. Unit quantitative  data also is provided to unit teaching staff, and to academic and professional  staff undertaking course design, development, implementation and/or review. 
Results of the evaluation of teaching are provided to the relevant academic  staff member, their supervisor, relevant unit and course coordinators, the head  of school, the executive dean of faculty and other University and faculty  managers as appropriate.
The University recognises that a substantial portion of QUT's learning  environment comprises joint, double or cross-faculty initiatives and that  evaluation practices and relevant roles and responsibilities will take account  of such offerings.
Students will be informed, through the Additional unit information document  and other appropriate unit and course information, what actions, if any,  were taken as a result of prior student feedback. This information  should be updated at least annually.

4.7.3 Roles and responsibilities of faculty management and teaching staff
